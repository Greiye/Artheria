[[Manascrap; A Novel 2024]]

The Modern world ended. 

Ours was history of the different races of Artheria banding together. We reached peace.

Then one of us pulled the trigger. the Atomic trigger.

Doesn't matter who did what anymore. World's gone.

We had planes. giant flying vehicles. Super yacht. We had mechanical suits as big as buildings. Telescopes that could see worlds away.
Gone.

Been what, 80 years since then?
City life's changed. A lot of the animals live with us in the sprawl now. Along with the monsters.


. The world is a mix of decaying industrial structures, overgrown vegetation, and remnants of a lost technological era. Massive, intimidating robots stand amid the ruins of once-great cities, their purpose long forgotten. The air is thick with mist and smoke, creating an eerie, oppressive atmosphere.

Amidst the chaos, there are pockets of life. Settlements have sprung up, where people use technology they no longer fully understand. Crowds move through these makeshift communities, interacting with various robots and driving rally cars through the dusty streets. The buildings, now covered in vines and greenery, serve as a stark contrast to the advanced but misunderstood gadgets people carry.

Characters in this world are equipped with a mix of rustic and high-tech gear. One character, Micah, stands out with his hooded outfit, carrying a PC tower on his back. One of his many deployable work stations. AR goggles on his forehead, and a mobile device in his hands. He represents the blending of past and future, surviving in this harsh environment.

The world is populated by diverse beings, from tech-savvy survivors to enigmatic figures with supernatural abilities. There are also androids and robots, some with animal-like features, coexisting with humans. This society, though grim and dark, is resilient, finding ways to adapt and survive amidst the ruins and overgrowth.

Overall, this world is a blend of decay and resilience, where the remnants of a lost technological era are intertwined with natureâ€™s reclaim, and survival depends on the ingenuity and adaptability of its inhabitants.

Magic users are still around, but no one uses it. Whatever killed off all the people and the plants killed off the magic too.

The people that use magic take a risk. They get manaburn. The magic is toxic. It smells. It comes out like gunk, every single time.
It does what it's supposed to, but the results are a mixed bag. a firebolt spell can also shoot out flecks of metal and rust. It cuts the users on the way out. Leaves an infection. that guy had to cut that whole hand off. Well, those that now about it. A lot of people say that it's just legends. That elves are so long lived that they just make stuff up to mess with the short lived ones.
with everyone's mana veins all gunked up, we can't use the doors anymore. common everyday doors.


It used to power the city apparently.


The real magic nowadays it Technomancers. Mages of the Script. The city spreads out a good 70 miles. It goes down underground for at least 1 miles. Something like 108 billion buildings.  it used to be something like 2.7 million buildings just on the surface alone. City planning is wild.


The world pretty much restarted. All the original code mages died the moment of impact. There's really only a handful of them left.

27,000 square miles, 1 mile deep.
81,000 cubic miles

something like 

They understand how to get into the safes. Warehouses of useful material. Non radioactive. Protected by Magically dense metals.

Thing is, they hide away. They've got a code.
