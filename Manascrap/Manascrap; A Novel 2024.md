[[Manascrap; A Novel 2024#Chapter 1]]


The story of Micah, a follower of Aether-Tech. Unie-Xorcerer. Warlock of Appel or Alpha-Beta Tech. Speaker of Linux and its Distro Followers. Admin to technology long gone.

The following is fiction made by me, for the purposes of studying. There will be photos.


## Chapter 1
- I'm a wizard. Well, a wizard in training.
- Previously, I was a hauler. I drove a truck full of goods. Food, Building Materials, slaves.
- I fought my last employers. It was a trade gone wrong. They led me through vats of toxic fumes, without the gear they had. If I had stayed, I would have died several deaths. The poison works like that. You think you made it out, but really a part of you was taken.
- There's a scar on my chest. It's a small one, no one really notices it, but I think about it a lot.
- I found a cozy place out here in the wastes.
- An abandoned structure. From a time long past. When the world ran on magic.
- I'm here because of the promise of a wizard society. A place where all your problems are solved. where you'll be safe from raiders.
- An older wizard that I met while passing told me about this place. We both thought it was a myth.
- This place... It still works.
- There's 'stations', the magic here still runs.
- There's a bot here too. It's friendly. Warm. Protected by 4 demon dogs. There's a fountain, berries, a hidden garden.
- I can stay here.
- I can learn the ways of a wizard.
  
The main character is staying in a place that's desert and an unending metropolis. There's vines, telephone lines, abandoned cars, debris everywhere. The sky is barely visible because of all the broken skyscrapers. It's post apocalyptic. the machine that's keeping the place working looks like a human and is friendly looking. the robot looks like the photo supplied. It has white flowers all over it. It has a docking station that is in the middle of the demon dog's beds.

## Chapter 2
I have been here for almost a cycle now. Been here since spring. then the heat of summer. then fall. winter. And now fall will come once more.

I have learned much from the station. There is still much to learn.

I have a casting device. I've seen what others have. They have stone tablets that vary in size. I do as well. These tablets have complex mana lines that flow all around.

There's different magics. Casting them takes time. I've seen a few Spellcasters here and there, each one knowing different spells written in different ways. Often in their own mother tongue. As if the arts weren't difficult enough.

This is what I learned from the archives here, in the forgotten building known as *Jacana*.

Jacana is a long building. Only one section works the one with the demon dogs.

They guard this machine. It's big and large. It tends the gardens and the water. It's old. It creaks when it moves. The dogs seem to give it purpose. Maybe this was a nursery at some point. There are rotten books with pages. Magical artifacts that show forms of people. I can barely make sense of it. It must have been from eons ago.



The Schools of magic that I learned

Eich-Temel. It's structure magic. Like creating zones where other magics are supposed to go.

Cies - It's transmutation magic. disguise magic. It can make spells look and feel a certain way.

Jaeyese - Functional Magic. Very powerful.
It looks different depending on the caster.

By default, these magics simply arrive.

One second they appear, and the next, they disappear. It's jarring. There are previous students on the tablets that report going blind or getting their fingers cut off when improperly using this type of magic.

Jaeyese tries to make these spells smooth. Rather than blinding, searing light, it slowly gains intensity, until the caster stops it.

This is just one of its uses.

So far, Jaeyese is a very attractive kind of magic. with enough mana, it can make a roof over my head, start fires.



### Where I am now, Cycle 
Right now I'm learning about:

**Manastone Structure**
All magic uses the same principles. Manastone is made from so many different types of metal we just call it Manastone. different softness, different uses.
There's different classifications of it.

**Scribenocumentation**
One must learn to teach the methods. You learn twice by teaching it to others. The Art cannot die out. It's thanks to this that I can learn the arts from other Technomancers from the last era.

**Aethernetworking**
This world used to run on mana. Not anymore. 

All these documents that I'm reading from come from some kind of organization. The Owlen Order. It's some kind of college of Aether that was once protected by water. Now it sits in a mirror plain. The Flat of the Sword.

These papers are about how Aether is used.

7 channels, each doing their own thing.

... Corruption Magic? What is this?

This material...

I need to learn the basic concepts of the old Aether Networks.

This was tech that was used for commerce aeons ago.



After this:
**Materialogueing**
if I understand the datums, I can find what I'm looking for faster.




The Owlen Order, off what the wizard that I met long ago, gave me enough encrypted mana for 8 Sessions. whatever is left, I can sell for a profit. For Euryuens. for upgrades. a haven of  my own.
