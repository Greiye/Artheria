Magic’s Law of Exchange
Much like the rule of energy conservation, magic cannot be destroyed. It can only be transferred into another form. 
	But unlike the natural law, magic’s depth of conversion can occur on the other side of the world.

100 limited entities in the world. When an entity is destroyed, it somehow is transmuted, taking another form in the world.

This means that from a single portal, a resource or item can come from it, then closes once the 5 points are exhausted.

Mikey’s Post: In working with your co writers, the fellow DMs.
I created the Magic Law of Conservation for this reason.
There may be times where you don’t agree with your fellow DM by working together in a world. Often they say that in DnD you’re building a story together. But dude, what if they decide to make your favorite race losers? Or kill your favorite hero? Return this kindness by STORY COMBAT.

What do I mean by this? So. The Magic Law of Conversion. Long story short, magic in this world is not destroyed. It’s locked in an ecosystem that’s constantly changing. And every entity in this world has points (out of 100). Through creative story writing, you can knock off some points from an entity, killing it. This creates an imbalance in the system. You destroy an entity worth 5 points, so now the world’s points go from 100 to 95.

You can now use these 5 points to introduce new entities into the story. Whatever you want, so long as the rule of conservation is maintained; only 100 points of entities at a time.

(The Law of Magic Conservation became a personal use thing. Not fair to ask others to abide by it. Too limiting. Best used for a hard magic system.)

Example: Dragons and Tieflings (Introduced into the world by Jason and Mikey.)
Dragons are worth 2 points, Tieflings are worth 3, 5 points in total.
I want to rid the world of dragons to make the tiefling race stronger. I’m attached to tieflings because I wrote the lore for them. Jason is most likely attached to his lore as well. We’ll both do anything storywise to keep them alive. (With consent of course.)

Dragons are also classified as Creatures: Few. Dragons can add to their 2 points by absorbing another entity. They can also lose their points when another entity tries to absorb them.

Tieflings are a Race: Average Population, worth 3 Points. This means they have the upper hand in terms of killing the dragons through sheer number of units.

In a session, a DM should write the session with a planned change in points or entity number, minimum of 1 point, maximum of the destruction of an entity.

This becomes a thing of math, in accordance with the magic system.
Simple war of killing the dragons. 3(Tieflings)-2(Dragons)=1(Tieflings). The Cost for slaying all the dragons into extinction is the death of all the tieflings. The 1 represents the last of the Tieflings (preferably 1 person, to retain the chance of repopulation.)

So how does Jason’s Dragon lore fight against this equation? By using other entities in the magic system to increase the value of his dragons. This is when the math problem gets bigger. What other entity does he employ? What edge do I give my entities? This is the DM’s Story Combat. We are the gods that are fighting against each other for supremacy.

In fairness, The session needs to be written with a way of reintroduction for the other DM to retain his lore. If my tiefling lore manages to erase his dragon entities, then they need to be able to come back into the world. How? By the creation of a magic artifact: Dragon Eggs. Or maybe the last dragon egg, idk, whatever Jason wants. This is fair. This gives us a challenge to retain our lore.

Whoever loses their lore due to destruction gets the available points to introduce new lore. I think this is fair.
