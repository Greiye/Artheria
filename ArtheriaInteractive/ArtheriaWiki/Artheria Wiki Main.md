**Summary**
 Artheria is a worldbuilding project that explores the interaction of hard magic systems with various fictional technologies in a closed world ecosystem. Parallel societies emerge amongst one another with reliance on local power sources like steam, solar, or the beasts in the area as the foundation of their infrastructures. This project is a deep dive into the "What if...?" in my head.

DnD 5e Hybrid. Changing rules depending on the wishes of the players, or if the rules have been updated. We are also taking rule modules out from other game systems. 

I also like Blades in the Dark, Cyberpunk Red, Lancer, thought I've only played those systems a few times.

---Play by Post Rules---

- Inactivity for a long time as discussed and noticed by the group will be put to a vote of removal.
- The game will explore tough topics in the same way _Game of Thrones_ handles incest and torture; Fine as a story, not okay if applied in the real world. I assume that you're a responsible adult that understands what a slur is, and how that's not okay in any scenario.
- Homebrew is encouraged.

This game is a DnD/X Hybrid Point Crawl. 

---Platform--- 
We'll be playing on Discord.

Keep a personal copy of everything in the event it's lost.

--Description--- You are members of The Caerne, a legendary mercenary band navigating the dangerous world of Artheria. After successfully rescuing a princess from a goblin infestation, you find yourselves thrust into a strange new mystery. The treasure you expected instead leads you to an ancient stone golem, covered in moss and towering 12 feet high. One wrong step sends you plummeting into darkness, only to awaken controlling the very golem itself. 

The world of Artheria is torn between powerful forces: the Elven, masters of mana; the Orcish, who harness the gruesome fuel of their enemies; and the Humans, ever reliant on steam-powered machinery. There are many other forces out there as well, but with the technology that you've found, It may only be a matter of time before this thing is used in an army's favor. with plenty of opportunities to form alliances, conquer enemies, and improve your camp. Will you navigate the chaos and rise to power, or become another forgotten relic in Artheria's history? The choice is yours.

 **The World**
  Artheria is vast, with many of the usual races and tropes in fantasy fiction, _and then some_. Each society/community are in different technological eras from each other. This is due to culture, tradition, and the harsh environment that keeps them mostly segregated. Trading is _difficult_. Adventurers and sailors return home with stories of wonders and dangers, so shaken by it that their words blur the line between truth and trauma. 
  
  **The Technology** In this world, the sentient races split off early in their development. Each society had a unique approach the problem of innovation and survival. Some used magical energies; others traditional methods like coal. 
  
  **The Closed Ecosystem Concept** Artheria operates within a closed ecosystem where energy is not created nor destroyed, just made into another form. The world has 100 points; each point reflects the strength of a creature or society. As the stories of this world unfolds, these points move around, reflecting changes within Artheria. Like Risk, the board game. 
  
  **The Interplay of the Societies and Their Resolution** Because of the Artheria's ecosystem, Entities must contend for points to grow stronger. They have to _take_ to live. The threat of destruction from rival governments, giant beasts or mad gods is enough tension to force alliances, agreements and wars for survival. 
  
  **Goal and Inspirations** My friends contribute to my world by making additions here and there, and playing TTRPG's with me. They've left their mark in my stories. In the real world, I hope that I make a small mark in theirs.
