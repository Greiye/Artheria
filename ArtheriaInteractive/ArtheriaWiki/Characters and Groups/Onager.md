#### 1 Onager and Value

You stood by your tent as you watched the Doctor handle that situation with the street children. He's a smart man, that Derby. Derby like the races. He's a fast man. Mentally agile. You'll remember him well.

You're an investigator, after all, it's your business to know everything. And it's not enough to know it all, you have to be accurate with your information as well.

It's accurate that those kids were sick. Derby did good telling them off. Would've gotten the whole band sick with High-Pox. It's nasty stuff. Here's looking at you, kid.

It's also accurate that he set that tent on fire.
You saw it. Derby didn't see you see, but you saw.

So did that one figure across from both of you. He didn't see that you saw. Derby didn't see that you BOTH saw. Did the other figure see you seeing?

A conundrum.

Two crimes in less that 48 hours.

Enter scene one of two. 
Two witnesses, one culprit, what motive? It's been a day since you saw it happen, but you just can't-

Oi.

You flash back to reality. You're looking at a fellow half-orc, with countless warscars on his forearms and shoulders.
You're both surrounded by fellow mercs. Humans, Half elves, the halflings, even a tiefling.

*LISTEN* when we're talking to you, greenskin. 

You 'now we all vote for e'ery initiate, roight? The boss makes it so. We all get a say in who joins the fam. We kick shit audiences right out, we do.

...What was I saying? Oh, yeah. So.

Yeah, we spared one of their cavalry. Hand messed up proper by a club. He fell off that big horse of his and into the mud, bent a leg like a toothpick, hanging off a sliver.

He weren't no threat. I told the boss to just slit his throat and be done with it, give 'em the good mercy, otherwise he's hobbling around like a proper nob his whole life. Soldierboy can't soldier on anymore, do what's best, give 'em the final rest.

but *NooOooo* we had to be good boys. Take him with us, bring him here to get patched up.

I shit you *not*, just this morning, the day after that whole fire business, on the **MORNING** we're to let him off, we find him in Karaku's tent. Bugger gave Karaku a second smile across his throat. ON THE DAY we're to let the bird out his cage. You believe this? Y' can't make this up.

Now, my issue's is:
...
How'd he manage?

Crow's got a clipped wing and a bent leg, yet he somehow got out his binds, found a knife (a dull one mind you), crawled through the mud **YET AGAIN**, and gave ole' Karaku the 2nd worst day of his life.

Bugger must have crawled a good 10 meters ah- that's 30 feet to you inbreds- across the camp to get to Karaku. Did he even know who's tent he was entering? beats me.

And **NO ONE** saw him? Not one soul? Too busy tuggin' each other all night long, eh? Foul play, I call foul. FOUL. Playyyy.

The half orc looks to Onager.

...Your tent was next to Karaku, as it were. And mine on the other side.

It's fine that you didn't hear nothing.
I didn't, and I was sober last night, mind you. My eyes and 'ears are as sharp as my tool. Not that one, this one:

He quickly unsheathes a small knife hanging on a thin rope around his neck and slams it on the wooden table.

My issue is this:

**...Could'a been you.**


or me. 
Could've been us both waking up to *faaaar* too close a shave. Karaku got the short end on that stick.

A pause.

...
So.

He gets up, puts a leg up on his seat, arm on the knee, and leans his body towards your answer.

Next time we find a poor sod after a battle:

Why ***shouldn't*** we make it quick? The boss is wrong on this one. He says it's bad for business, that it'll keep the good nobles from hiring us if we start stickin' 'oles in the dead whenever we fancy, but I say it's not so big a deal. I say it's not that deep. 

I say we all *-ahem- ...'vote to change the terms of capture within a warring scenario.'* as the big man would put it.

The whole band is here, it looks like. All 10 or 15 of you, but not the Captain.

The fellow half orc is putting you in a spot where everyone will remember what you say, for the sake of dramatic flair.

What do you do?

The Captain's orders were clear, an' I'll follow them.  The day they aren't or I have issue with them, I'll ask him.  As to what the prisoner did and how, I'd be happy to investigate the situation, track the gimp down, and finish what his horse started or drag his ass back here for his crimes.

He looks you up and down your face for the truth. Then turns to a shiny glint that catches everyone's eye.

In the distance, the whole band sees the head of the camp approach. He smiling as he's walking into camp with a sack of supplies over his shoulder.

*Case by case*, eh? Mkay. Mkay. I see you, greenskin.

Ladies and gents, we got someone used to throwing their weight around a bit. Figured as much, wot, with the old 'Udo getup he's got on.

He grabs his knife from the table and lazily uses it  to gesture to your uniform.

Whelp. I'm off on my duties.


With this, the rest of the group disperses from the open chow hall.
You're unsure if their disposition on you has changed or not.


 ## 2 Onager and the Other Half-Orc

Your time in the city watch has given you ample experiences with countless mercenary groups. What do you think of them? They're sellswords. soldiers for hire. When a city gets big enough, It can't contain itself. It needs more. And often the neighboring city has that 'more.'

Nothing new under the sun. Where there's mercenaries, there's war. Where there's war, there's money. It's the lifeblood of any large scale operation after all. The city guard always pulled you in for more shifts whenever merc outfits were around. Their lifeblood goes right to barfights and barmaidens. It's the natural state of things.

But not Yarl's group.
Well okay, *not as much.* In comparison.

What you've learned is that Yarl's a cut above the rest. He's taken vanguard gigs for scholars and book types even when there was a gig with better pay. He's done solo day gigs that paid coppers. Yarl'd come home with a nasty cut from those ones.

There's something about him.

I say we take him after he's done with one of his charity jobs.

You wake up in the night. Everything's gray, but you see clearly. You peek out from the gap of your tent entrance.

It's the same half orc from before. The dramatic one with the scars on his arms.
You listen for a bit longer.
They're planning on turning Yarl for a bounty when he's at his weakest.
Seems the life of a mercenary means you'll be adored or hated wherever you go, whoever you are. In the next few legs of the group's journey, there'll be a few places where the band leader's got a few coins on his head.

I've seen the git lead us on these goody-two shoe gigs. Remember that contract where we just digged for old junk nonstop for the braniacs? 10 hours of diggin' per day? paid 30 gold. Just the 30! He gave up a contract for 200.

You peek to see who he's talking to.
*It's half the camp.*

I say we turn this dictatorship into democracy. We vote him out, and focus on profits. No more of this charity nonsense. 

We're **mercenaries**, you louts. Not proper envoys for the greater good. My language is gold coins, big-titties gals, and uhh... golden ale. Yeah. that sounds a'right. 
Dodn't rhyme but sounds good nonetheless.

It's midday, 3 hours to sunset.
With your connections, you can talk the local guards into arresting everyone listening to the Half-Orc. Maybe plants drugs or pay children into binding themselves and hiding in their tents. Make them look bad. It's one way to go about it. It'll take you three hours. Likely it'll turn into an all out brawl.

But you also remember why you joined. Maybe not for the money, but the city guard wasn't exactly the best pay either. You could also join them. That scarred half orc really does happen to know how to get the best contracts. Where you like it or not, he's got a dramatic charisma to him. *When he speaks, everyone listens.* You get on his good side, he'll be an asset to you.

**Cast out Yarl** or **Report half the camp?**

Onager comes out of his tent while the half-orc is on his rant.

to the gathered crowd Are we plotting a mutiny now?  Have we so little loyalty that we would ambush a man you have all sworn to?  No man here is chained to the March.  If you're unhappy with the leadership leave with your honor intact, don't tarnish your reputations and ruin your careers.  Better jobs are out there but who would hire a mercenary company that can't even be trusted not to turn on each other?

He stairs down the scarred orc as he speaks his mind knowing well he may have just earned himself a knife in the back or worse. Then he looks at each of the audience in turn...

Which of you will be the first to attack Yarl?  ...and how many of you has he saved time and time again?

...and how many will fall before you manage to take him down?

Onager stands tall to his full 6'8" height and crosses his massive arms in front of him as his eyes surf the crowd looking for reactions.  Trying to see who he might have to put down first and planning his attack to take as many of these boys down as he can before he's killed if they turn on him.

The scarred Half Orc stands up on the wooden table. He's still looking up at you.

Onager simply grins unfolding his arms.
...

**HE KNOWS TOO MUCH, LADS. GET 'IM.**

They rush you. Weapons and all. It's a battle of swords whooshing past as you bob and weave through them. Masterfully you deliver blows that could kill a man if you wanted to.
Arrows and bolts fly by. Some of these attacks are well orchestrated. You find yourself ducking and rolling on the ground just to get by.

Despite your size, you have this uncanny ability to tuck and roll, but immediately get back up to a standing position.

How's he doing that? A bit impressively, really.

The commotion stirs everyone awake. Seems this uprising was something like an elephant in the room. Those who just now waking up join the brawl.

...
A good 30 minutes later, the ones plotting are either tied up, knocked out, or long gone.

From the 14 members of The Caerne, it's now just 7 who stand; bruised, but united.

The Half orc who instigated all this is tied up. He's got broken arm from when he pulled his little knife on Onager. He's a good fighter. Onager had to break it; He was that close to getting an artery slashed open.

@Half Orc Mercenary#283788 I'd hang you myself now if I didn't covet the opportunity to see you squirm as you explain yourself to Yarl.

No need.
The bossman Yarl approaches.

Onager grins again stepping aside with a respectful nod to Yarl.

I've known sometime what this rat was up to. Oh, uhhh...
He bows apologetically to Iron-Tail.

It's easy to see a threat when they're wearing their swords on their hip. This one... he's got a sharp tongue. That's the real dagger he's got hidden away.


...but a dull wit.

Yarl looks to Onager. He hands him a long coil of rope.
Onager starts tying the noose and looks for the nearest tree.

So, Investigator. What should we do with him? I can't just leave him be. He's to be an example. An example that everyone can see.

Oh! ...I see you've an idea already.

...
He watches you 'take the rabbit through the tunnel' when it comes to noose making.

We can hang him or I can cut him loose and beat him to death.  He called for my execution and yours, he deserves no less.

Yes, I see the issue. Equal force, equal response. It's the way of the world.

You catch him looking to someone in the distance. It's Kayla, the feathered owl girl.
Then he looks at Derby. Then you. You can see the gears turning in his mind.

...Make it quick. Painless. I'm not a monster.

After a quick patch up of wounds, Everyone works together to create a kind of hanging podium out of crates and barrels. Of the seven uprisers, only 3 remain, the half orc and 2 others.

Those who want to watch can. Most don't.

The noose is set. There was a nearby tree tall enough.

The crates are stacked tall enough to where all he has to do is take one step, and the rope will snap his neck.

 It's around the neck of the scarred Half-Orc.
He chuckles nervously.

Heh, heh, heh.... I guess I got a real answer from you after all, eh? 'Bout a quick death?

Can't fault you's. I'd've come back with an even bigger group.

What's your name, greenskin? You can at least do me the honor of that.

And don't give me your 'Common Name' either. I want your full Orcish name. You can do a fellow orc that much.

Onager walks over behind the half orc and hauls him to his feet.  "Onager Caerne".  Then with a swift motion, he reaches his left arm across the 1/2 orcs body and grabs his right shoulder and crosses his right arm in front of his face grabbing a handful of hair and jerks violently snapping the 1/2 orcs neck before letting his body fall to the ground.

The body hangs, the neck extending 5 inches longer. His feet dangle , toes just barely brushing along the grass.

Immediately the other two get down on their knees and start praying to whatever god name they've heard. They know a hopeless situation when they see it.

Yarl wears a face of disgust. It can't be helped. A sane person wouldn't be happy about a constructed event of death.

He decides to let the other two go. He drags them both by their binds to the edge of camp and cuts the rope binding.

I watched Torgon as I did Big Rupert. I know he was the mastermind behind it all. You two were just talked into it. Cold-cocked by our giant Investigator friend before it even registered what happened. Probably thought 'strength in numbers' right?


... I see any of you two again - passing in the street-, off chance in a tavern, ***I break you***. then and there.

You two become sailors if you want any guarantee of safety.


The two flee, one leaves a trail of urine from his pant leg.

Yarl can sense Onager right behind him.


... It's the right decision, friend. Whatever god they prayed to found mercy in me this day.

Some days I think myself too merciful. It's not easy. But nothing worth having comes easy, no?


He looks to you for an answer.

Nothing. Onager says in agreement.

I'm sorry I wasn't able to get any of them to see reason. I had no illusions about how things would end up between the 1/2 orc and I but I'd hoped to sway a few of the others.

We're mercenaries. Comes with the trade. For every good apple, I get 11 bad ones per dozen of new recruits. These bunch need a silver piece and a tankard of the bitters to be talked into anything.
You did good. Better than good.

The body hangs the whole day, until sunset. Yarl and Kaelrith take him out to the forest.

**Onager has earned Yarl, The Caerne Leader's Trust!**


Onager
"I'm just glad I managed to stay alive until some of the others joined in!"

Yarl
"Come. Let's see how everyone's faring. We've lost 3 souls, and half the camp. We'll have to investigate a bit, gather ideas on the next big move.

Also, I joined in at the tail end of it. How do you do that thing that you do? You're easily 200 lbs or more. What is that, 90kg in Orc measurements?

What I'm asking is: how did you roll backwards twice and get back up in a standing position? I've never seen anything like it. Is it like, a magic gravity spell? Or..."

Onager
"just good blood I guess."


## 3 Onager Return

As you're playing with the children and enjoying your time as 'Mr. Playground', you see it. The corner of your eye. You can't believe what you're seeing.

You set the half-orc girl down and stare by a carnival stall.

You hope you're wrong.

No. You're right. You're always right about these things.

At the dart throw stall, it's ***one of the two mercenaries from before.*** 

A human with a big, bushy beard.

Look's like he's on a date. The date looks like she's having fun, holding onto a pretty big teddy bear.

It's only a matter of time before Yarl sees him. You're not sure how he'll act. Not sure with these many kids and witnesses around.

You remember his words.
''I see any of you two again - passing in the street-, off chance in a tavern, ***I break you***. then and there."

All this time with him, you know him to be true to every promise; and every threat.

Distract the group away? Tell Yarl what you saw? Show them the same respect you showed the scarred veteran Torgon?

"Excuse me children but I see an old friend I need to have a word with.  I'll be back in a moment."

...he says gently placing the airborne and otherwise elevated children on the ground before walking directly toward the man and his date.

With a polite smile he says to the mercenaries date...  "Excuse me miss but might I borrow your companion for a moment?"

Onager guides him a few feet away, whether he likes it or not, still smiling back at his date.

"The Yarl is a spears throw away and will certainly at the very least cripple you if he sees you.  My suggestion to you is you tell your young companion I've notified you of urgent business and you regret that you must depart.  Stay at your own peril."

"I must return to the children, sorry to be the bearer of ill tidings.  Do take care."

With that he lets the man's arm go and casually returns to the waiting children.

Onager returns to the heart of the festivities.

He casts a glance behind him. The woman is holding onto her teddy bear, looking around for her bearded companion. Seems he's left earlier than planned.

Yarl
"Onager, where did you go? You were gone long enough for the -Ow! For the little ones to find someone else to bully. They've chosen me as their latest target."

The young half-orc girl is laughing as she and her brother are running around Yarl.

Suddenly she yanks on Yarl's arm. She's only about 4 feet tall, yet her one sudden pull forces Yarl forward like a ragdoll. He's off balance.


"My, aren't you str**oh gODS**.

... Onager, I see the strength kicks in your people *very* quickly."

The 2 women of the group return with as many flagons as they can carry.

Jenna
"We've returned! The day is saved!"

The group cheers. Everyone takes a flagon and maintains the positive energies all around.

The rest of the night is a blur of ale, heavy bardic bass and cheeful orchestra...
