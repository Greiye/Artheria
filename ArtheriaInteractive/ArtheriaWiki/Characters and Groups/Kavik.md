Kavik is a former adventurer who was the first warlock of [[The Patron]].

## Appearance
He is a male Tiefling. During his time as an adventurer, he is regarded as strikingly handsome by almost every person he has come across. He has long, shaggy brown hair, and a fitted robe that exposes his body. He wears leather bracers and a red sash that keeps his robe from flowing.

## Adventuring Years
Kavik at some point came across the patron. Shortly after, he assembled an adventuring group with him as the de facto leader. The party consists of [[Blue]], [[Bones]], and [[Hands]].


## Pain and Suffering
Every member of Kavik's Band met untimely demise. They were either killed or handicapped, or subjected to a terrible fate. This prompted Kavik's retirement.
## Retirement
After his time as an adventurer, Kavik had a son named [[Kazka]] with a Teifling woman.
