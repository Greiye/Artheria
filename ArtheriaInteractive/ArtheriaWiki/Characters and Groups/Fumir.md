A lovely tiefling spellcaster who fell in love with [[Kazka]].

Due to the unknown status of [[The Patron]], Fumir is not a warlock. At the moment, Warlocks are rare.

She was last seen leaving Kazka in the middle of the night.

It is believed she returned home to other tieflings.
With the latest story of [[The Caerne]], she may have something to do with the [[Azul Empire]].
