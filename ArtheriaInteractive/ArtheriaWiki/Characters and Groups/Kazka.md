![[3Kazka.png]]
Father is [[Kavik]].

Started his group with [[Gruum]], [[Jerry the Bombadier]] and [[Fumir]].
The group is often known as the [[Kazka's Band]].


Childhood
He was raised in a small settlement, [[Aralon]]. To a former adventurer father (Kavik) and grew up wealthy


Teenage Years
When he was old enough, his father Kavik exposed him to [[The Patron]], the source of Kavik's power.

Adventuring Years
Around the age of 18, Kazka joined the [[Adventurers Guild]], where he met the members of his band to leave Aralon.

Golden Years

Slow deaths
His bandmates slowly died out due to the patron's cost.

Fumir leaving
Fumir left Kazka in the middle of the night, when they were sharing a bed together and looking out from a tower that overlooked a city.

Decline
Kazka has since been a washed up hero. He is now around 39 years old and spends his time drinking and doing odd jobs. They became famous as "The Band," but bad luck from his patron caused the deaths of his teammates. Kazka realized his powers were a curse and stopped using them, becoming a drunk and wandering from town to town.

A follower of [[Petrichor]] introduced him to [[Ubuntuism]], and he trained as a Paladin to atone for his past. Dedicated to Petrichor but still occasionally drinking, Kazka is a cranky old man who helps others despite complaining. 

A Quest
Kazka at age 38, was found by a pair of scholars, who employed him to find an elephantlike creature and collect its tusks. In return, he was given Fumir's location on a map. The scholars made it evident that Fumir would be there, no matter what. [[Cerwind]] and a child named [[Terry]], who need his help to retrieve [[Einkhala]]'s tusks. In exchange, Palladium offers information about Fumir, and Kazka reluctantly agrees.

Raq
Kazka is now caring for a teenage Orcish child named [[Rackyoshiet 'Raq']]. 


#### Relationships
The Patron
The Patron has a personality. It doesn't enjoy the pain and suffering that its existence brings. It tries to be as helpful as possible to Kazka. Even the Patron doesn't know what the price of his contract will be.

Dialogue Example:
Scene: A medieval tavern with a few people inside.

Anon: Hey there.

Kazka:  "... Hey."
The purple-skinned Tiefling lifts his gaze from his drink.
Eyes narrow at the newcomer. He takes in the scholarly attire.

Anon: "You're Kazka Zamir?"

Kazka: "I am," he says.
His face is stiff. His eyes, the color of molten gold, study the scholar with a glimmer of curiosity.

Anon: "I've heard your stories. Fumir and the others. The Band, they called you."

Kazka: "Mmhmm."

Anon: "You're a legend around here, you know."

Kazka: "I'm flattered."
He continues looking into his flagon of ale.

Anon: "You don't seem like one to enjoy the spotlight."

Kazka: "I do not, no. Thank you for seeing so."

Anon: "My apologies if I've overstepped. I've traveled far to find you."

Kazka: "A job I presume?"
He sips his drink.

Anon: "Yes, Kazka. A task of some urgency."

Kazka: "I'm listening."

The scholarly stranger unfurls a parchment, revealing a map with a red 'X' drawn on it.

Kazka: "What is this?"

Anon: "This map, Mr. Zamir, marks the location of a creature known as the Einkhala."
"It's an elephant-like creature, but with tusks that hold significant value for our research."
"We're in dire need of its ivory."

Kazka looks at the map with a furrowed brow.
He then looks into the scholar's eyes.

Kazka: "...poaching."
"you found me... to poach for you."

Anon: "Not exactly. Think of it as... a quest for knowledge."

Kazka: "What kind of knowledge? The knowledge of how many tusks we can poach before someone stops us?"

Anon: "The Einkhala's tusks are said to contain ancient magical properties that could revolutionize our understanding of the arcane."

Kazka: "This a regular animal out there? Minding its own business?"

Anon: "It's more... misunderstood than anything. It's an opportunity to unlock ancient secrets. To help people."

Kazka: "You are not helping your case here, stranger."
"What makes you think I care about your 'ancient secrets' or 'helping people'?"
"You're obviously going to bring this creature loads of pain and suffering"

Anon: "Look, I know it's a big ask."
"But the research we're doing, it's vital."
"The knowledge could save lives."

Kazka: "Vital, huh?"
"Convince me why I should care."

Anon: "We're studying how magic interacts with the very fabric of our world."
"The tusks of the Einkhala are said to hold the essence of pure mana."
"This could be the key to unlocking the secrets of our existence."

Kazka: "Uh huh."
"And what makes you think I'd be interested in that?"
He takes a swig of his ale, eyeing the scholar skeptically.

Anon: "Because, Mr. Zamir, your history speaks volumes about your desire to protect and serve."
He glances around the tavern, then leans in closer.
"And because we believe your... past affiliations may grant us unique insights."

Kazka: "Past affiliations."
He snorts. "You know nothing about me."
The Tiefling's hand tightens around the spear propped against the table.
"But go on, tell me what you think you know."

Anon: "Your history with the Adventurers Guild, the battles you've won..."
"Your dedication to your patron, Petrichor..."
"And... your connection to Fumir."
He pauses, watching for a reaction.

Kazka: "Fumir."
The name hangs heavy in the air, a silent echo of the past pain it brings.
His eyes, once narrowed, now bore into the scholar's, searching for truth or deceit.
"What do you know about Fumir?"

Anon: "Only what's documented. Fumir was a powerful sorceress, part of your band."
"She... left. Vanished, some say."
"We believe she's seeking the same knowledge we are."
"The same knowledge this Einkhala can provide."

Kazka: "...You think I'm a fool?"
"You think I don't know where Fumir is?"
"You think I care?"

Anon: "Please, Mr. Zamir-"
He waves a hand, calmly. "We're not your enemy."
"Fumir was once your companion. I understand if it's difficult."...
"But we need someone like you."
"Someone who understands the cost of magic."

Anon: "We believe she's moved on from her past, much like you, Mr. Zamir."
"But we have reason to believe she may still be seeking the same knowledge we are."
"The knowledge of pure mana, the essence of our existence."

Kazka: "Pah."
"You think I'm that naive?"
"I'm not some love-sick fool, chasing after a ghost."

Anon: "We do not wish to manipulate you, Mr. Zamir."
"We are aware of the burdens you carry."
"But Fumir's involvement is coincidental."
"We truly believe this quest aligns with your personal... journey."

Kazka: "What's the catch?"
"You want me to get involved in something that's going to end in bloodshed?"

Anon: "The catch?"
He pauses, stroking his chin thoughtfully.
"The tusks are... volatile."
"If not handled correctly, they could be dangerous."
"That's where your experience comes in."
"But no, we don't intend for harm to come to the Einkhala."

Kazka: "Last I checked, tusks are made of face bone. I guess we 'gently' saw them off?"
"You are not who you say you are. You are a villain. I accuse you."

Anon: "Look, Kazka. I understand your skepticism."
"But our intentions are pure."
"We aim to study, not to harm."
"And if your heart is truly with Petrichor, this could be a chance to understand more of the divine spark in our world."

Kazka: "Pure intentions?"
He aims his body away from the stranger.
"I suppose you've also a bridge to sell me."

Anon: "Mr. Zamir-"

Kazka: 
"I've heard enough."
"I believe you waste my time and yours."
"Leave."

### Kazka's Interview

**You’re at a bar when the one person you don’t want to see walks in. Who are they? How do you react?**

Fumir, but not because I don’t want to see her. Because I thought she died a long time ago and I don’t want her to be affected by my patron. I would not only lose my cool, but I would try to get out as fast as possible and get far away from her, no matter what it takes.

  

 How would you react if you were catcalled?

I would either ignore it or not hear it in the first place because I’m drunk.

  
How would you react if you saw a friend who owes you money spending frivolously?

I wouldn’t bother. No one owes me anything. It’s the other way around.

  

 Your friends are speaking unfairly about a mutual friend. Do you speak up?

Yes, friends and family are (were) everything to me.

  

 How would you react if you witnessed a victimless crime?

I have slowly transitioned to Lawful Good throughout the years so I could not let it slide despite it not causing harm.

  

 What would you do if someone brought up your biggest insecurity in front of a crowd of strangers?

I would feel ashamed, but I would own up to it. I am well aware of the damage me and my patron have caused.

  

## How would you respond to an apology from somebody you still can’t forgive?

I’ve been too prideful in my younger years, I would push my pride aside and forgive.

  

## How would you break up with someone?

I would be completely transparent and have the decency to talk to them about it.

  

## If you won the lottery, how would it change your life?

I would give it away to those in need.

  

## Would you trade ten years of your life to be richer?

No, I had a great childhood with the riches from my father’s accomplishments, but after experiencing what he did to obtain those riches, I now know it’s not worth it.

  

## How about to be more beautiful?

No, beauty is subjective.

  

## More intelligent?

Yes, I wish I started on a path for wisdom instead of power earlier in my life.

  

# Reflecting on the Past ⏳

Take a trip down memory lane to explore your character’s backstory in more depth.

  

## What childhood memory still makes your toes curl?

When my father passed.

  

## What memory makes you swell with pride?

Everyday I was with the Band.

  

## If you could relive one day of your life without changing anything that happened, which day would you choose?

The day I met Grum, Jerry, and Fumir.

  

## What about if you could change the course of events?

I would refuse to utilize my patron.

  

## Who were you closest to as a child?

My father, Kavik Zamir.

  

## What’s something you quit, that you now regret giving up on?

I regret that I quit trying to find Fumir.

  

## What was the best party you ever went to?

They say one’s company, two’s a crowd, and three’s a party. I was lucky enough to have a party every day with Fumir, Grum, and Jerry. Each day was better than the last. That is, until it wasn’t…

  

# Relationships 💞

Questions to get you thinking about your character’s affairs of the heart; love, friendship, and family.

  

## Who was the first person to break your heart?

My father when he passed.

  

## Who was the last?

Fumir when she left.

  

## How well would you handle a long-distance relationship?

Not well. After experiencing the loss of both my family and the Band I now realize that I am not so good on my own.

  

## How would you feel after a one-night stand?

Empty.

  

## Have you ever kept someone in your life who you didn’t get along with — for example, a friend you disliked or argued with? Why did you avoid saying goodbye?

My relationship with Jerry was a strange one. We weren’t nice to each other, but we weren’t necessarily mean to each other. We just were. While his delivery was aggressive, he always meant well. Couldn’t say goodbye because I loved having that bozo around.

  

## How would your best friend describe you?

Grum would describe me as cocky and arrogant, but ultimately a man of good intentions.

  

## How would your romantic partner describe you?

Fumir would describe me as someone who she couldn’t be around. Not because she didn’t love me, but because she didn’t like what was happening around me. A jinx.

  

## How would your boss describe you?

My boss? My patron? He would describe me as a fool by association with my father.

  

## How would your parents describe you?

My father would have been proud. Of what? I don’t know.

  

## How would your worst enemy describe you?

Formidable. Others would say “flee on sight.”

  

# Habits and Routines ✔️

Learn more about the rhythm of your character’s days, and the ins-and-outs of the more mundane aspects of their life — they can be surprisingly illuminating.

  

## What do you think about in the shower?

Ironically, the only time my thoughts aren’t racing is in the shower. I don’t know if it's the sound of the water, but it drowns out the noise.

  

## Do you stay up late or wake up early?

I often stay up late.

  

## What do you do if you can’t sleep?

I drink.

  

## Who or what do you turn to when you’re upset?

Unfortunately, in the past, I’ve turned to alcohol. I admit that I still do every now and then, but I have since found solace in Petrichor’s teachings.

  

## Are you more of a text person or a phone call person? Why?

I’d rather speak face to face.

  

## What does your morning routine look like?

The days that I don’t fall into an alcoholic binge are actually pretty structured:

- I wake up early and force myself out of bed.

- I meditate. Not in an attempt to organize my thoughts, but more of an opportunity to “observe” them.

- I train every day to keep my combat skills polished.

- My ultimate goal every day is to seek stillness. Fate has tested me with one catastrophe after another.

- I achieve this by reading and ensuring I learn something new every day. One of my favorite ways of decompressing after training is relaxing in the Aralon Hot Springs.

- Memento mori is a must. In contemplating death, I define my purpose.

  

# The Good, the Bad, the Ugly… 💀

Time to get critical. Use these questions to explore the less-than-lovely aspects of your character. Even the most heroic of protagonists have a couple of skeletons in their closet.

  

## What’s the worst thing you’ve ever wished on somebody (and who was it)?

I wished Fumir to be with me.

  

## When was the last time you lied? What made you do it?

“Everything will be okay.” This was the last lie I made to Fumir before she left. I lied so she’d stay, even though I knew it wasn’t true.

  

## Is there somebody you haven’t been able to forgive? What did they do? Do you want to forgive them?

Although I understand that he was just pursuing his dreams, I will not forgive my father for introducing me to the Great Old One. I want to forgive him, but I lost everything, including him.

  

## Can you lie easily?

No.

  

## Do you handle rejection well?

Yes, I am not bothered by being disliked. I cannot control how others feel or think about me so why dwell on it?

  

## Have you ever done something illegal?

I have killed before.
