### Previous History
It seems The Caerne is a very old group. Anna has mentioned that it has been around long before Yarl became the leader.

Some people have heard of the group, or have heard of Yarl.


### 'Disbanding'
With the discovery of [[Telandor Savior|the titan]], Yarl saw it fit to set fire to The Caerne Camp and disband the group. Although he disbanded the group, the members are very much still travelling together.

Unseen, the group had left [[Carmine Reach]] in the middle of a feast dedicated to them to leave safety. They have since travelled to [[Boilmarsh]], where Iron-Tail hails from.
