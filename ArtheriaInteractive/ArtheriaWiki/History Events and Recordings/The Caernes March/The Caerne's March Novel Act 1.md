## **Act 1: The Princess and the Goblins**


**The First Summer**

Spring has ended for [[The Caerne]], giving way to the sweltering heat of summer. The cool mornings have become hot, with some afternoons so unbearable that staying outside is almost impossible. Taverns capitalize on this by offering refreshing beverages served with imported ice, a luxury that comes at twice the usual price. After all, ice in the summer isn't cheap.

The mercenary group has undergone significant changes in recent months. For the first time in years, the leader feels a sense of _safety_ among his hires. He has been seen more often around the camp, rather than spending his time away from it.

Anna, the Elven member of the group, is a rare sight.
Elves typically prefer to live among their own kind, avoiding the company of 'the short-lived,' as elves put it.
Even rarer, the news Anna brings: A king’s audience for the Caerne.

This news prompts a long journey to **Carmine Reach**.

Upon arrival, the group splits up. Yarl and Anna visit the king to discuss the matters at hand with one of the many rulers of The Red Kingdoms.

--------------
The group reconvenes in the commons of their Guest Chambers, where Yarl called them to attention.

![[CarmineCastle.png]]

Yarl
"Everyone, gather up. We just finished up with King Carmine."

He outlined the situation with his usual demeanor. "Princess has been kidnapped. The culprits are suspected to be goblins, lurking in the caves by a local beach."

He added with a wry smile, "Believe it or not, this sort of thing happens at least once every season. The goblins probably overheard a peasant talking about 'the precious princess' while skulking around in the streets. Maybe they decided she was worth capturing."

Yarl continued, "Our task is straightforward: track the goblins by their stench, rescue the princess from her holding cell, and bring her back. Oh, and before I forget—"

He gestures toward the young catfolk behind him and the Elven woman standing nearby.

"This is **Hawk**, our scout. The irony of his name and his feline grace is not lost on me. You've all seen **Anna**, she was in her own mechanized carriage ahead of us. She's our herald and spokesperson; I suppose some may call her our bard."

Anna offered a polite curtsy from a distance.
Anna is a gorgeous Elven woman in white loose robes. She moves slowly and elegantly.


Yarl addresses the group again. "Anna will stay here in the castle to keep an eye on our camp and supplies. The rest of us are on the sortie to the beach. We won’t be sightseeing; we leave immediately."

He adds; "Goblins get bored quickly. When they’re bored, they get hungry, and when they’re hungry, they forget what 'valuable' and 'precious' means."

"Travel will take us two days by carriage, but we'll be on horseback to speed things up."

Yarl turned his attention to Onager. "Onager, we might need to procure you a steed. Perhaps a Clydesdale. We can’t have you literally dragging your toes as we ride out."

"Alright, pack up. We leave in an hour. That should be enough time to sort out a horse for Onager."

He glances out the window, noting the bright daylight.

"Anna, I may need your charm and connections for this. Let’s move."

Yarl mades his way to the door, holding it open for Anna to follow. She caught everyone’s eye with a neutral gaze, convey an unspoken message. She then respectfully bows and follows Yarl.

Derby takes a moment to recall his goblin experience, preparing for the task ahead.

As the party is rummaging around and getting ready for their first big assignment, their scout Hawke gets up from his corner seat.

He's a sand-colored Tabaxi wearing a green sleeveless long tunic and metal and leather Vambraces (forearm armor.) A little short for the usual catfolk.

He's got a curious look on his face as he silently walks to  and examines each party member as they conduct their business.

He stop at Jenna last.

She's busy thinking about what she should bring. The usual throwing knives should do.

She feels someone staring at her. Jenna turns to see Hawke's emerald eyes.

yyyessss? Jenna asks


Nothing! says Hawke

He turns back to seat and lounges on the chair. After a while he closes his eyes and looks to take a cat nap; hands across his belly, one leg up on the chair arm.


Iron-Tail  replaces her chain with plate in preparation for the assault on the goblin camp. While she was there, she looks over the throwables to see what they had for chuckin'.

Iron-Tail dons her plate armor.

As the acting quartermaster of the band in charge of logistics, she's kept a mental list of the potential grenades and thrown weapons.

They have quite the armory. Knifes and axes are plentiful, a bushel of javelins and spears. The only few things that do stand out are few bottles of *Acid* and *Holy Water*.

There's also the stuff that Derby's been keeping in stock as well. *Alchemist Fire.*. It's supposed to be treated carefully due to its ignitive properties when exposed to air.

Seeing as Iron-Tail had to flirt a little bit with a creepy salesman to get the needed materials to make it, he can probably part with one or two bottles. They have a good amount after all.

Derby casually prepares his gear, accustomed to carrying everything he typically needs. As he assesses his equipment, he realizes that while he is well-prepared, acquiring an additional medical kit might be a prudent decision.

Iron-Tail made sure to secure a few healer's kits for the acting doctor of the band. Derby finds it and stows it in his pack, keeping the reputation of 'a walking pharmacy.'

Onager makes sure he's got all the arrows and javelins he needs.

Yarl whistle calls the group. heads peer out from the castle window and down, onto the cobblestones.

Yarl and Anna are minuscule when they stand next the Clydesdale horse.

-------------------
The group meets up with their leader on ground, leaving their more personal effects in their own castle private quarters.

The horse is enormous. It must be standing at 6'4''. It's head alone is as big as a human torso.

Upon seeing Onager, the horse becomes anxious. It's pulling away left and right, forcing Yarl to get swayed along with it.

The horse rears back, momentarily reaching a height of 12 feet or so.

Onager has experience with horses during his time in the force.

First, Onager grabs a handful of hay from a passing wagon and tells everyone to keep a distance from Yarl, give it some space.

Then he approaches the horse slowly. Carefully.
He stands to the side of the muscular steed, avoiding direct eye contact. He speaks softly and slowly in a calm tone. 

His hand out for the horse to sniff and get used to his scent.

Five minutes pass. It's at ease now.
Onager slowly strokes its neck with light consistent pressure, maintaining the softness of his words.

This is probably what, the 17th horse he's done this to?

"That was... *impressive.* I thought I would have had to keep you up front to watch for any  signs of a sudden buck off. You must have spent a lot of time with horses in a previous occupation.

This horse can be used to pull a single wagon in the future, but we got it mainly for you.

It's only fair that you name it, Onager."

In front of you, a dark brown horse as big as you in context. It has black hairs and white 'feathers' (The hair on it's hooves).

It seems rather calm. It doesn't move when you hold its reins. In fact, it seems to already be leaning its whole body closer to you affectionately.

**What do you name this giant steed?**

Onager glances to check the animals gender and take in its other physical qualities before considering an appropriate name

"How about, 'Frostfoot'?  Will that be ok with you, good steed?"

Thank you Yarl, this is a fine animal and a generous gesture."

Yarl
"You've been like a right hand man since you joined. It's an honor."

If ever you leave The Caerne, you take Frostfoot with you. He's yours to care for, from now on."

Frostfoot neighs loudly as he pushes you as a playful challenge.

"Right. We're all set.

Time is against us. The longer we wait, the more like the princess is in danger of..."

He stops short.

"We're going to the stables.
 Kaelrith, you're riding with me. Derby, Iron-Tail, you two are going to ride together. 
 
 Onager's got Frostfoot, and Jenna will be riding by herself on account of her *warm personality*."

That's 4 horses total. The less horses the better. Speed's a factor here.

No.

Kaelrith immediately takes off and takes flight into the blue sky,doing a barrel roll overhead.


The sudden gust of wind kicks up dust and debris that lands on Anna.

She brushes off the dust from her clothes with a vengeful expression.

Again, she looks to the group, makes sure everyone is looking at her via eye contact, curtsies, then takes her leave.


... Until she gets tired. She's not going to fly there the whole 6-something hours. {There goes Anna. We'll see you soon, I guess.}

Well, I guess someone can ride with me. Derby? Iron-Tail?


It doesn't matter. We're wasting daylight. We can switch off or something, I don't care. We either get paid or forever be known as failures in the merc world.

Jenna
What about our scout? The Leonin?

Yarl
Hawk. Do the thing.

Hawk playfully salutes.

Then he starts to sprint on the ground like a cheetah, climbs up a 3 story castle wall and does a double pike backflip, soaring a good 8 feet onto an adjacent tree branch.

He's hanging off just the claws of his feet, swinging to and fro.

Hawk then salutes the party, then flips and climbs head down along the trunk. He does a graceful cartwheel and lands with a flourish in the exact spot he started in.

I prefer jumping from tree to tree. Or cat-sprinting.

He winks at Iron-Tail.

Jenna claps.

Wish we had *you* in the carnival.

Right. On horseback. *Let's move.*

The group goes to the city stables and fetches 3 horses. The band has 10 horses in total to pull their wares and employees.

Due to the nature of mercenary work, the group has always switched off on horses. All the time spent feeding and caring for them has made the horses docile with whoever rides them.

All 3 horse pretty much look the same; mostly white with spots of brown/black. They don't have any discernible personality traits aside from all their hairs being braided.

Horse Names
    Midnight Storm
    Ember's Grace
    Whispering Wind

With 4 horses in total, they set off with Yarl leading the sortie down the South road.
Kaelrith can be found flying overhead and Hawk is keeping up, flashing a mirror every once in a while as he hops along the road's treeline.

### To Goblin Beach




![[Forest.jpg]]

Yard leads the line.

Frostfoot follows with no issues. Every so often a passerby will double take and stare at Frostfoot and his Half-Orc rider. It's not everyday you see a giant person on giant steed.
They make the other riders look like children in size comparison.

The roads are arduous, but The Caerne is unbothered.

![[AbandonedInn.jpg]]

After 4 hours of riding, Yarl gives the signal to stop.
The Caerne get off in a part of the road with some buildings. Maybe they're lucky one of them's an Inn or some sort. A place where they can momentarily rest.

Onager hops off Frostfoot to stretch his legs a bit and leads him by his reins towards the buildings.

Frostfoot is compliant and is calm as Onager leads him around.

Whatever paths that used to exist around here has been reclaimed by grass. Rotten wood. Rotten furniture.


No soul can be felt. Kaelrith flies down with an exhausted expression. Hawk turns up from the treeline and reports the same thing: No one here.

Yarl chooses one house and enters. 
An abandoned Inn. It's the many tables and benches with a central kitchen area that gives it away.

Been some time since the owners were here. There's build up of moss on the decayed walls. Most likely this used to be a small tavern community that took what they could and left quick.

The Caerne reins their horses on a hitching rail and rest for 2 hours in the shade. Members are either inside the inn or out under a tree.

Onager pokes his head through what *used *to be a window. These buildings have been abandoned with nothing immediately worth taking.

Jenna
My troupe used to pass places like this all the time when we travelled from town to town.

It's just another abandoned community. I guess after the ceasefire, people didn't want to return in case the war reignited.

Hawke
The scout nods to this in silence.

...

The group benefits from the rest. Everyone's bodies and backsides feel a whole lot better.

Above them, there's still plenty of sunlight.

Kaelrith is now riding with Yarl.

Jenna is looking a tired from the riding.

...

The group reaches their destination without issue.

### Beach Arrival

The sun's starting to get a little low. There's about 2 hours left until the sunlight dims to a dull purple.


Kaelrith is flying overhead. She's led The Caerne here, to the sandhill that they now stand upon. According to the written instructions in Yarl's hand, this is the place:
The entrance to a cave by the beach.

![[BeachCaves.jpg]]


Kaelrith and Hawk return with a report.

Yarl pulls everyone to listen to Kaelrith and Hawk.

By the entrance, there's a field littered with **broken siege equipment**. Broken catapults, wagons, the like. Rusted metal. One of them look like Anna's carriage.

These caverns have a few sunlight openings.
In one chamber, the biggest one furthest from the entrance I saw... I don't know how to describe it, *a broken metal dome?*

Onager thinks.
Was there a battle here at some point?  Was this a stronghold of sorts during the wars?

Onager takes a look at the siege machines himself.

Hanging from a piece of wreckage, a piece of blue fabric, aged and discolored from months of sea salt and sun.

A memory is triggered.

Derby
Kaelrith But is it safe down there? that metal dome you mentioned piqued my interests. perhaps I could take a look

Hawk
@Derby#283773 No, it's not safe, Doc.

I crawled up and over those openings. I got a good look at the goblins emerging from their nastly little dens. The nocturnal little beasts are just now waking up, and they're moving in a line *towards *the metal dome.

Saw the **princess** as well. She's in a big cage, covered up by rotten wooden boards and rusty metal junk. Not too far from the metal dome.

You see the dome, you see the princess.

Kaelrith, You mention the nets?

The Owlin shakes her head.

There is a *LOT *of nets. 
Me thinks this goblin group knows how to fish.

Kind of odd. Usually they're not that smart.

Derby
Goblins… a wretched collection of living mistakes. I can't help but feel a shred of pity for that poor lass, caught among such filth.

Hawke
@Derby#283773 It's not so bad for her.

I saw that they gave her a bucket at least.

A bucket? That's... *uncharacteristic *of goblins. Hmm.

Derby
That’s... odd. A feeble attempt at mercy, yet it’s something. and the very idea of fishing among their kind...

Clearly, it's not impossible given their anatomical similarities to orcs. However, it is... weird.

Onager
Maybe something remains of the caves previous occupants.  The siege engines that litter the beach appear to be Azul Empire craftwork.  They wouldn't have thrown themselves against goblins den.  This was once something more.

...and the goblins are simply underlings.

Yarl
... You're right. {Why didn't I notice that flag?}

Hmm.

We gotta be careful when we go in, then. Assume some kind of Azulan threat is in there.

I'm gonna brief us. a quick summary of the plan to get in and out.

Anything else before I brief? Iron Tail, anything?

Onager
Nothing from me, at least not without surveying further.

Yarl
I trust in Kayla and Hawk's assessment. They usually report all they can see. We've have to walk in to see anything more. No further surveying needed, unless you want them to do a once-over with a goal in mind?

Kaelrith steps up and nods. She's waiting for the word to do a once over.

Kaelrith
Onager, Anything you want me to look for?

Onager
Nothing that wouldn't be entirely speculative.

Kaelrith nods to Onager, then takes a step back.


Iron Tail
Nothing yet, no. Seems like the goblins are in it for the long haul. Kinda weird that no one really tried to dislodge them until now.

@Iron-Tail#283774 Unfortunately, goblin infestation is often a problem for the lesser folk; Not a problem to one with guarded stone fortresses.

Yarl
@Iron-Tail#283774 Unfortunately, goblin infestation is often a problem for the lesser folk; Not a problem to one with guarded stone fortresses.

Hawk
@Iron-Tail#283774 In this case, it *became* a problem. The princess and what not.

Yarl
Right. I'm gonna brief us.

 The Objective:
We're rescuing a princess from a goblin infestation.

We need her alive. Worst case scenario, prove that we saw her remains. Her tiara or clothing is fine, that's usually custom made and is therefore unique.

We don't have to kill every single goblin, It's a rescue, not an extermination.

Get the princess, ride back to Carmine Reach Castle.

 The Battle Plan
I'll take lead anchor. Front and center.

Onager, you're on my right. 

Iron-Tail, you're on my left. I saw you don that plate armor, I know you know what you're doing.

We're front lines.

Backlines will be Dr. Derby and Jenna. Jenna isn't a fighter, so she'll do what she can with throwing knifes and a few fire spells.

Support will be Kaelrith with vision. Hawk will be overhead with a crossbow. I'll be using hand signals and and a mirror to communicate with them.

**Get the princess, get out.**

Yarl nods. He puts his helmet on, checks his buckler fitting, then unsheathes his short sword.

He moves towards the entrance.

Kaelrith takes to the sky, and Hawk takes his leave.

Yarl
{We maintain element of surprise. We watch for traps.}

#### The Raid

The party is at the left edge of the cave mouth. One can hear the hollowness of the cave echoing out.

It's dim in there, with parts being pitch black.

What do you do?

Onager checks the orientation of the heavy bracers he wears to deflect blades in melee and gives the team a nod.

He takes a moment to let his eyes adjust and tries to orient himself to where the dome and cage would be given this new perspective.

Onager reviews the scout report.

2 sunlight openings visible. 2 chambers visible above. One chamber where the goblins reside.
One Larger chamber with the metal dome.

The goblin cave structure would then be something like:

1. Cave Mouth
2. Passage to Goblin Dens
3. Goblin Dens Chamber
4. Passage to Metal Dome
5. Metal Dome Chamber (Princess)

Onager narrows his eyes in the darkness.

There's a pitfall just ahead.  Be careful.

Yarl looks ahead. Sure enough, it's there. Had it not been for Onager, they would have walked right into it.

In a low whisper, Yarl points at the crude device and explains it, so the party can keep an eye out for something similar.

It's not a deadly trap, but close to it.

The goblins seem to have taken a net and suspended it at the corners with bags of sand. Then they layered banners above it and covered it up with a thin layer of fine sand.

Had anyone stepped on it, they would have tripped down a foot and landed on broken speartips and rusty swords; No doubt covered in poisons or a thin spray of urine.


Iron-Tail
If we can block the way into the dens, we may have less to deal with once we grab the princess and go.

Yarl hears Iron-Tail and looks about.

...There's quite the amount of crates and barrels. Yes most of them are broken, but something can be assembled as an obstruction.

Yarl
{What do you have in mind, Iron-Tail? A funnel for when we leave? A total blockade?}
{Oh, you mean to totally block this passage, and go through another passage, hindering them as we leave?}


The party looks about. That can be done. This deep in the caverns, one can see the orange sunlight of the larger chamber in the distance. From where the party stands, the **glint of a corner of a large metal dome** is visible. It's something like 500 feet away.
The darkness from the party to the shiny glint is pitch black. What else could the darkness hide?

Iron Tail
As long as it keeps the goblins at bay and away from us, it should be good enough.

Yarl looks at the materials available.
If we work fast and quietly, we can make a strong improvised barricade. One that they won't be able to get through. Nets and planks.

But we have to **be quiet**.

It's Onager and Iron-Tail in the clanky scale mail and platemail. Can you two stand guard? Hawk will help.

Me, Derby and Jenna will make something. 10 minutes, tops. That okay? I want a sound off.

Iron Tail
I can stand vigil, of course.

Jenna
Fine by me. I'm gloved up. I can help.

Onager
Guard duty... got it!

Derby
{10 minutes hopefully is more than enough for something.}

derby said while kneeling on the floor with his suitcase open, making note of everything he could use. he closes it and gets up, ready to go.


Javelin in hand, Iron-Tail waits for an an enemy threat. Her eyes shine with the familiar glow of a nocturnal creature. (Darkvision)

The 3 begin to craft some kind of barricade.They use the nearby supply of metal plates, crates, and netting.

The 3 don't have darkvision. They're stumbling in the dim light, confusing wooden planks for metal sheets.

Upset, Jenna takes her gloves off. With the help of Derby and Yarl, her fingers and intense concentration,  she welds a couple of metal plates together. She's quite the natural, not only making a decent source of low light, but making spot welds where they count.

...
5 minutes pass. It's still a work in progress, but it's coming along.

A lone goblin appears in the caverns.

Onager and Iron-Tail are shoulder to shoulder to each other. Simultaneously they spot it.

It's a rather disgusting creature. In the colorless grey of darkvision, they see it clearly within 60ft.

it's got overgrown teeth, ears that are different lengths with a bit of hair on the tips.

It's skin is lumpy and full of warts. Its belly is round but its uneven arms are all bone, barely any muscles.

This one is wearing an oversized blue colored soldier uniform. It's not only ill fitting, it has numerous rips and tears, and what looks like countless stains.

It holds a rusty rapier in its hand and is sniffing the air.

![[Goblin1.bmp]]


Iron-Tail know that she's armed to the teeth, and that she wouldn't make it super far by sneaking. So she tries to be crafty, trying to lure it away from the party by chucking some debris in a direction away from them.

Carefully, Iron-Tail picks up a good sized rock that's perfect for throwing. She gets a good grip on it and throws the rock a little past the goblin, up at the stalagmites above the lone goblin.

Startled, it turns and looks the other way, wondering what that sound was.

Onager readies a shot with his bow as the goblins turns toward the sound of the rock and lets an arrow fly. It's a new longbow. Something like 110lbs draw weight. It flies true.

Onager takes aim, taking a step forward to account for the tension of the bow.

(Nat 1)
...And slips on loose gravel. He gets close to doing an involuntary split as the arrow makes a weak arc through the air, landing close to the lone goblin.

The goblin turns. He sees The Caerne.

He lets out a terrible, pained wail that echoes throughout the caverns. *He's calling his warren to arms.*

Yarl
Gods above- Okay, looks like we're not doing the sneaky route.

He unsheathes his shortword and takes out a torch.
***Let's get messy.***

#### Battle

Iron Tail
Well, at least half a barricade is better than no barricade.
Iron-Tail rolls her shoulders, unsheathes her sword and shield, and steps up to the plate.

Jenna cracks her neck and rolls her shoulders as well
Worry not, Iron-Tail.
I've got a plan.

Derby draws his rapier while still holding onto his medical supplies. thinking of a way to stop the incoming horde of goblins

Onager
MOTHER F@#$%R!
Onager kicks away the loose stones and quickly retrieves his bow.
Can anyone drop some light down the hall to the warren?  I can hold this hall while you all retrieve the girl.  That is if I don't manage to SHOOT myself!
He aims to shoot the first thing he sees


Derby takes a deep breathe. Rapier in one hand, Hand crossbow on top of it. A trick he's seen some city guards do.

He keeps behind Yarl, who has resumed his position as center line. Any thing that moves gets a bolt in the head.
"Everyone, Remember the medicine doses I've given you."
Everyone pats their pocket. A 'Derby Dose' as Yarl described it.

We're counting on you Onager. Jenna, get some light for him. The rest of us? Let's head towards the dome and rescue that princess!

Jenna nods at this.

We move swiftly as we can, since they don't know exactly which direction we're coming from.

Iron died exactly that, moving towards the domem

Onager takes what cover he can from impromptu barricade and the walls of the hallway.  He has an arrow nocked and drawn and 5 more arrows in his bow hand ready to reload.

Jenna, I'm gonna drop a torch ahead up ahead at the hallway. Make it bright.

She nods.

Yes, boss!

Yarl maintains center guard. To his right, Iron-Tail.
Behind in, Derby.

Staying by the barricade, Onager and Jenna, to keep their escape path clear.

They move.

Yarl moves ahead, short sword out.
He then sets an unlit torch, then throws a very small bottle of alchemist's fire at the torch base.
The moment the finger sized bottle cracks and opens, it ignites and sets the whole torch aflame.

Jenna is left of Onager.
She stays put and makes a hand gesture, an orchestra conductor asking to raise the volume.
*Control Flames*

Yarl's torch brightens twice as much.

For Onager, the **view all the way to the metal dome is bright and clear**. One would have to be a sniper to hit something from this far, but the view is clear.

The one goblin is screaming its head off, while taking cover behind some stalagmites.

An arrows heads straight for Yarl.

He swings and slices the arrow in two as it sails right for him.

Onager lets loose another arrow. This time, the goblin can't avoid it.

Onager's second shot enters the goblins open screaming maw the tip of the arrow fully exiting the back of the creatures skull along with several inches of the shaft.  The force of the impact takes the filthy blue uniformed goblin off its feet to land dead several feet from where it drew its last breath.

The Goblin lays dead, its lifeless body dimly illuminated by Yarl's distant torch.

Iron is going to keep bringing up the right side, charging with Yarl towards the dome.

The group continues.

Yarl, Iron Tail and Derby reach the Dome's mouth.

Onager and Jenna are dots in the distance, but are within earshot due to the cavern's reflective surfaces. Anything that front lines says will echo back to the backlines.

Overhead in the setting orange sun, Kaelrith flies overhead.

The party's eyes are met with a shiny glint from the chamber's overhead openings. It's Hawk, with a mirror. He's using the sun to send light signals.

The very edge of the chamber (Top Right) goes out to sea.

The metal dome is large. It's over 20 ft tall and has signs that it's been here for decades. It's covered in rust, moss and rock. It's mostly rusty at the part of it that's touching the waters.

Metal Dome Openings
There's 2 cave-mouth openings that lead into the metal dome, left and right. It looks like the openings just formed naturally from rust and water.

Between the metal dome and the party is...

Mountains and mounds of junk. It's a collection of random items, treasures and dead carcasses. 
There's everything in here; broken seige engines, dead fish on rope, human and elvish bones, golden furniture, rusty spears pointed out from netting, really everything.
It stinks of salt, rust, and rot.

There. Goblins. 3 on the left, 2 on the right.

It's as Yarl says.

Each group is come out of the metal dome. 3 on the left, 2 on the right.
They're looking confused as they communicate with each other.

Then they spot the party.

Suddenly they're crying out to each other, wailing in a broken dialect of Orcish that's more grunts than words.

You don't see any traps.

You take a guess at what this dome is.
In the rust you can see trace lines on it. You've heard of something like this, but you thought it to be an olden Elven story.

These could be... *Leylines.* No different from a ritual spellcaster's chalk lines in the ground.

Is this thing a giant preparation for a spell?

Iron-Tail casts a curious look at the metal dome.
Looks like this thing used to be a big old focus for come incantation. No idea what kind of spell it's for, but it's something elven.

Onager shouts down the hall to the warren after a moment of silence with no goblin horde approaching.

Come get some you little f@#$ers!

Iron-Tail is going to get a running start, pulling out one of her javelins and attempting to nail one of the goblins on the right!

The Javelin flies true, nailing a goblin right in the stomach.

The goblin grips it at the shaft. This is a fatal injury. 

They all scramble for weapons

Derby takes aim at a goblin.
The bolt flies...

It nails a goblin
The bolt finds purchase on another goblin just left of Iron-Tail's Javelin. It's a thigh shot, nothing substantial.

Drats. I was hoping to hit bone, for once.

Yarl looks up at the opening. With what little sunlight left, he flashes a weak light towards Kaelrith from up top, and Hawk from the opening edges.

Yarl is taking cover behind some small garbage mounds.

With his buckler hand, he takes out a hand crossbow and fires blindly into the goblin crowd: The one that Derby and Iron-Tail are attacking.

The bolt flies...

it misses. It reflects off the metal dome.

**Jenna! Get messy!**

A Jenna appears, leaving Onager by himself.
Jenna takes a deep breathe. She casts an unsure glance at Iron-Tail.

She gets just a tad left behind Yarl's shoulders, forming a triangle with her fingers and thumbs.
Eyes flash a bright orange. The ignition of her hairs and clothes get stronger. Everyone can feel a sudden increase of heat radiating off Jenna. Yarl's leather shoulder patron begins to bubble and char ever so slightly.

From her hands, 3 bright rays of fire, like shooting stars shoot out.

It hits 2 of the 3 intended targets, the unhurt one just a touch faster than the rays. (Scorching Ray)


One goblin is completely obliterated. The scorching ray of heat melts his eyes and face with the scorched bone visible. She slumps to the ground, dead, like a sack of potatoes.

The other Goblin is severely burnt. His fingers have melted into his chest. He's fighting with one rusty scimitar in one hand.


Overhead, there's a flickering of light.
Then, a flickering light becomes a bright torch from where the party stands. It's lobbed over to where the 3 goblins stand: The goblins with the javelin in his belly and melted fingers on its rotten leather armor.


The fires are bright and dazzling as they land upon the surviving goblins.

One flame finishes off the one with the javelin gut.

The other goblin, hand fused with its chest, is rolling on the floor, then diving into the mounds of garbage, doing everything it can to put out the fire all over its body.

It's the smell of the camp all over again. Rupert's body fats and hot leather, merging into a distinct, sickening smell.

**❄︎⍓︎♏︎ ⍓︎◆︎ ⧫︎♏︎⌧︎⧫︎ ♒︎♏︎♏︎?︎ ?︎⬧︎♏︎ ✌︎☹︎☹︎ ?︎✌︎?︎?︎ ♐︎?︎ ?︎ ☝︎♋︎⬧︎⧫︎♏︎?︎⬧︎ ●︎♋︎■︎♑︎◆︎♋︎♑︎♏︎ ?︎✆︎!**

A deep voice calls out to the goblins. The pitch and timbre...This isn't a goblin at all. This thing sounds... far too big.

**?︎♓︎♏︎ ●︎♓︎?♏︎ ⧫︎♒︎♏︎ ❒︎♏︎⬧︎⧫︎ □︎♐︎ ⧫︎♒︎♏︎❍︎ ⧫︎♒︎♏︎■︎✏︎!*

The remaining two goblins nod.

They begin to sprint to the the top of some garbage mounds.

The two goblins each reveal... A siege turret of some kind, with bright blue banners on each of the machines.

Oh no... that's... a net gun... and a ballista?

The party only has the effort and manpower to effectively stop one of the siege machines:

The net gun is aimed at Kaelrith.

The ballista is aimed at Hawk.

You may only be able to save one.

**Who do you save?**

Choice

Which one do we take down? We can't take both of them down.

We don't have the firepower to stop both, we can only disable the one.

Who the hell leaves instructions on how to operate such machinery in goblin-tongue?!

Then for now, he's going to stay put and continue doing what he said he would do unless he receives orders to the contrary.

Iron-Tail is going to start towards the ballista, with aims to smash it up or turn it against the net thrower.

Iron-Tail makes her way up to the Ballista to the right.
It's difficult terrain. Each step sinks her a bit lower into the junk.
She's above the heap, and can see the putrid goblin as it cranks away to aim the ballista at Hawk.
Iron-Tail has enough time to do something on the offense, but can't move any further.


Iron-Tail lobs a javelin, nailing the goblin in the chest with such force that they are launched out from their position and are pushed into the pile of trash, where they make a small divot.

The other goblins witness the death of their own. They are scared. enraged. unsure.

The one goblin that Iron-Tail just shot is frozen, the force of the javelin piercing through her rotten leathers, her arms locked rigid as the neurons in her brain all fire up for the last time.

The wooden cogs of the net gun turn, now manned by the remaining three goblins. It makes such a racket as the operators rush feverishly.

*click*
*fwoosh*


A giant canister shoots out a ball. 
The ball expands out;

In the last remaining seconds of the dusk light, The Caerne sees a wide black net sail through the sky, and **envelop Kaelrith**.

She drops from the sky like a rock.


Yarl looks on, horrified.
Oh, no. no, no, no...
He turns his head back to the caverns and yells out;
### **Onager! Frontlines!**

Fucking fish nets.
**Derby**. 
Hawk will find Kayla. You tend to her wounds. She's likely broken both wings.
We're fine here.

Go.

Derby nods. He packs away his hand crossbow and heads out.


### **Hawk! Find Kayla!**


A very bright, surely arcane, green light flashes from the ceiling opening.


Choice resolution:
**Destroy the Ballista and save Hawk**
{Destroy the Net gun and save Kaelrith}

Yarl hikes up a junk mound and indiscriminately throws a bottle of alchemist fire at the net gun.

It hits a random edge of the net gun and startles a goblin, but nothing catches fire.

Jenna rushes up just behind him, hands focused on another fire blast.

From the area around her hands and chest, she lets loose a beam of heat. (Aganazzar's Scorcher)

The beam cuts through the wood of the net gun, and sears the meat of all three goblins in a horizontal beam arc.

That area catches on fire.

Everyone, eyes out. Assume active traps and more goblin ambushers.

Onager hears Yarl's call to the frontlines.

On hearing the command Onager dashes 60 towards the party.

Iron-Tail is going to check up on their netted companion to see how they were doing. She expected them to be doing rather poorly, which is why she was hustling.

Yarl scours the many trash mounds.

Finally he see it:
***The Princess.***

He heads over to the cage.

The Princess

Wordlessly, he grabs the lock of the cage and begins to whisper to himself. Those around him hear is as some kind of Elven spellchant, but they can't be sure. (Heat Metal)

When the lock gets hot enough, he begins to swing at it with his sword.
He makes quick work of it, until the lock is sliced in half and falls to the ground.


He calmly opens the cage gate, to a startled princess.

My lady.
He bows deeply and lingers, with his upper torso and face aimed to the floor as he speaks.

I am Yarl, of the Caerne.

I was sent here by your father, **King Carmine**, of *Carmine Reach.*

I am here to retrieve you, and ensure your safe return to the Reach.

You shall ride with me on horseback, as was necessitated for your expedious rescue.

You shall be in the safety of your castle in a day's time.

Princess Carmine is a young, blonde woman with a beautiful face, and well tailored royal clothing, sporting blue and white clothes with red accents.

It's only been a few days, but her clothing is dirty and torn. She looks only a tad bit dehydrated, but remarkably fine for someone in her current predicament. She has one hand tucked in the inside of her knee.

She wears a rather stereotypical tiara on her head, with jewels placed in its many sockets.

The princess is initially wary, but as soon as she hears Yarl's announcement, she throws herself at him.

My savior... *hic*

Please... take me home.

Unsure of the proper course of action, Yarl gently embraces the princess and looks to the women of the group with a *'What-in-the-7-hells-do-I-doooooo'* look.

Jenna makes an  "I-dunno" shrug.

Seeing that Iron-Tail has disappeared, Yarl gently pats her back and awkwardly speaks

Erm yeah... we have saved you! Princess Carmine. And nowww we will make sure! that you on your wayyyy.
{Jenna, **HELP**}


Jenna very discretely walks over and takes the princess's attention away from Yarl.
She peels her away from him.

Everyone gets a decent look at the princess.

Her skin is flawless behind the greasy dirt marks all over her.
Her Elven ears are pronounced enough to display where her good looks come from.

Eyes swollen from tears that simply slide down her supple face. An expression of true worry and sadness from being in the care of goblins for a minute too long.

There's a trail of blood on her dress. 
**The princess's pinky is missing**, gauze wrapped around the hand and focused on the nub of it.

Oh dear...
What happened?

She says nothing, and just buries herself into Jenna, only for Jenna to violently push her away.


Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, princess. I'm...

She brushes her hair and reveals the many ignitions in the locks of her silky hair.

I mean not to burn you.

Please, my gloves. The cloth of my people is warm, but it will not leave a mark on you.

Jenna offers her gloved hand to the princess.

She grabs it. A grin flashes on her face.

I've been in the cold for too long. A welcome change, to be sure.

The two smile at each other.


Onager arrives at the scene. He scales the trash mound and sees Yarl.

@Onager#283776 Onager, good.

We've reached the princess.

I don't seem to see Iron-Tail anywhere... I'm sure she's clearing the area of threats.

@Onager#283776 Me and Jenna will return to the horses with the princess. You and Iron-Tail secure the backlines as we leave.

He describes the horse plan as such:

Horse 1 (Midnight Storm)
- Yarl
- Princess Carmine

Horse 2 (Ember's Grace)
- Jenna
- Derby

Horse 3 (Whispering Wind)
- Kaelrith
- Iron Tail

Frostfoot: Onager's Steed
- Onager

Jenna, you do all you can to avoid burning Derby with your hair. Speed was a factor in rescuing the princess. Maybe some sort of turban?

The princess will be riding with me. If we're accosted, I will speed past, and leave you all to slow them down. If the princess is hurt en route, then this will all have been for nothing.

Iron-Tail will be with...

He pauses.

Jenna begins to lead Princess Carmine to the horses.

Princess Carmine brushes her hand away, and makes an announcement.

...They were going to offer me to **a statue of some kind**.

...An offering to their god. To see if I was worthy.

Worthy of what, I have no clue.

They've offered so much to the statue.
Food, treasures, other goblins. Fellow elves and warriors from all the races.

The statue...

***It... speaks.***

I've been in that cage this whole time, but as they all went to that metal dome, there was a bright light from an arcane source, I'm sure of it.

It spoke in an old Elven dialect from thousands of years ago; I only understood an occasional word every so often. I've never heard of a voice like that. So quiet, so soothing, yet so penetrating in its volume.

 It was neither man nor woman; *something else entirely.*

Be careful.

And watch out for the ***goblin master***.
It's a grotesque thing. ***bulbous growths on its body and sickly yellow eyes***.

What do you mean by goblin master? Like, a giant goblin amongst them?

No, it's something else entirely.
It speaks in a harsh voice, and the things respond to it. It's not a goblins. Something else, much larger, much more intelligent.

The master was the reason for...

She gestures shyly at the bucket in the corner of the cage, horseflies are making rounds about the makeshift toilet.


Hmmm. Well, whatever, the thing is, we're too close to the horses for it to do anything.

We move now. Onager, co-

A bright light begins to flash from the metal dome.

....No. We leave it along.

We got what we came for. Whatever that is, we leave it undisturbed.


Boss, we don't know what that light is.
Goblin master? Speaking statues? What if it's some god that stops us from leaving? We have to at least check it out.

Or, some kind of elaborate trap. We go in there, we get killed.

I have been here for a total of 3 days.

Before I was in that cage, there was another princess from another Red Kingdom.
They took her to that blue light, along with many a treasures.

...I never saw that princess again. I was her replacement.
I didn't see any of the trinkets that the goblins brought either.
I just remember that the goblins that left that metal dome were... *fewer*.


Then you help my case.
***A horse kicks a stable hand dead, you learn to avoid the stables, yes?***

Well yes, but...

The statue spoke old Elven, like I said.
Or at least, a version of it I've never heard before.
It was enough Elven for me to understand one important part;

It was asking for....
## ***'The Perfect Champion'.***



I say we check it out. Besides...

Jenna points to the leftmost edge of the metal dome.

There's an unmistakable yellow glint of metal, stacked tall in a pile.

***...that's a lot of gold.***

Yarl pauses. Internal conflict forms in his furrowed eyebrows and tightened lips.

...Curse of the hells...

Yarl looks to Onager.

You're my right hand.

We need the gold. But we have to secure the princess as well.

I motion we stay here and see what's in the dome.
When Kaelrith and them get back, we explore the dome.

Yeah, where even are they, anyway?

## Visiting the Injured

Iron-Tail finds the other beast-folk easily in the dark. Her Nezumi eyes adjust quickly to the dark purple light of a freshly dawned sun (Nightvision).

She finds Derby, doing chest compressions on an unconscious Kaelrith.
The netting is like a blanket , the way it sits around the Owlin. The netting is frayed and shows desperate cuts, like several knifes wildly slicing at it.

Hawk is on standby, watching the scene unfold.
There are bits of black netting stuck in his fur, moreso closer to his paws.
He's breathing heavy as he paces back and forth, drinking as much water as he can from Derby's canteen.

*Haa* *Haa* I've never seen her this banged up *Haa*

He drinks the water with no regard if it touches his whiskers or not. It drains along the fur of this mouth and neck.


Derby stops doing chest compressions.

He takes a lamp from his pack and struggles to get it to work, using 2 pieces of flint.


Gods be damned...

Hawk harshly takes the 2 flint shards and produces a flame in one go, starting the lamp.

**Save her, you quack!**


Derby takes out Kaelrith's Derby Dose, the one he had given her earlier, and injects it into her thigh.

### *GASP*

She rises, swinging her arms legs and wings about. She's screaming into the night.


Hawk rushes over and closes her mouth.


Shh shh shh, yes, I know, it's rather painful, but you have to bear it, Kaelrith.

Can't have them know where we are.

Hawk backs off, and grabs a handful of wild grasses growing on the stone shores of the beach.

He fashions a thin rope made of grass, and inserts it into Kaelrith's mouth.

{ bite onto that for now. You can beat me for this later. }

Kaelrith is hyperventilating as she bites down on the makeshift rope. There is a large hair fracture crack on her beak. She is staring blankly into the void.

It's obvious in the way she moves. She looks to have landed on the her left side. first the left foot, then the left hip, then the left shoulder, and finally her left wing, with her left arm protecting her head from cracking open. The arm is bent backwards.


**The owlin has broken the left side of her entire body.

There is no guarantee she will ever be able to fly again.**

I have to set all the bones to make sure they don't flop around. Your muscles are bundling all of your bones together, we have to set it right.

It's a miracle you're even conscious! They say any situation where you're screaming like this is better than a situation where you're not.

With the driftwood around, I can fashion some kind of stretcher, get you somewhere safe. Don't you worry, my bandmate.

I'll help, doc, whatever you need, I'm your man.

You're gonna be alright, Kaelrith.

In the darkness, Hawk gently grabs Iron-Tails's wrist and pulls her away from the scene for a moment with her.

... I saw what you did there. With the Ballista and the Net Gun.

*I've seen what a ballista can do.* At best, the bolt would have gone through my head. Quick, painless, I wouldn't even have known I was gone. I would've been just another cool cat in the kitty litter box up above.

At worst, the bolt would have hit the ground underneath me, and I would've tumbled down a good 40 feet down and buried in stone rubble.

But... I'm here. Whole and healthy as what you see before you.

And not... *like that.*

For that...

*I thank you.*


He bows deeply.


Without looking, Hawk finds Iron-Tail's hand and holds it gently in his. The pink pads on his fingertips are surprisingly soft and warm.

A confident smile finds its way to Hawk's whiskers. He looks Iron-Tail up and down, then into her eyes.

I'll have to return the favor sometime. Potentially over drinks and a lovely meal.

He looks at Iron-Tail with eyes half open, his neck tilted towards her, with a cocky grin across his face. He waits for some kind of answer.


@Hawke#283961 I'd definitely need a meal and a drink after everything that's happened here. We can discuss a place and a time once we're out of this dank hole.

Hawk, I need you!

Hawk smiles.
He lets go, letting his claws ever so slightly brush through Iron-Tail's hands. It leaves faint white lines on her skin.


We're fine here, Iron Tail. Meet back up with the crew. Me and Hawk will find some kind of stretcher. She'll be fine, given time.

{Doc, she's... you know.}

In normal circumstances yes, but you're dealing with a war medic, here.
With a few healing potions and some of my experimental medicine, we may be able to get her walking and flying.

Hope so.

Iron-Tail nods and heads back towards the rest of the crew who was investigating the giant and securing the princess. Hopefully they've already cleared all the weird sexual tension before she got there.

The Dome

Oh, she's back!
Jenna waves to Iron-Tail, signaling that they're having a discussion.

I'll keep watch while if you all want to check out the sphere.  Sounds like its best we stay OUT of it though.  This "Master" and whatever goblins remain may still be about.


...and probably not real happy with our presence.

Point taken. - Yarl

Yes I'm back! The doc is currently working on getting our companion back to shape. So, how have things been with the princess?

Jenna pulls the princess towards Iron-Tail.
Princess, this is Iron-Tail. She's like, the engineer of the group.

She curtsies to Iron-Tail.
Charmed.

Princess Carmine is a young, blonde woman with a beautiful face, and well tailored royal clothing, sporting blue and white clothes with red accents.

It's only been a few days, but her clothing is dirty and torn. She looks only a tad bit dehydrated, but remarkably fine for someone in her current predicament.

She wears a rather stereotypical tiara on her head, with jewels placed in its many sockets.

She's visibly missing a pinky finger. The blood tracks on her royal dress.

She is obviously forcing a smile and some decorum through her sunken eyes and internal torment.

Iron-Tail
A pleasure to make your acquaintance your majesty. I only heard a few bits and pieces from the echoes off the dome, but we're going in further to see what's inside the dome?

Jenna
Well, *you guys* are.

I'm taking Princess back to the horses.


Yarl
If Iron-Tail is here, then the way is clear. 
Jenna, take her to the horses. Give her my rations and water, whatever she needs. 
Please leave now; We're not going to keep her here any longer.
And have Derby take a look at that finger.

Jenna salutes Yarl. She then takes her hand and supports her through the junk terrain.

I might be able to make a little something something for that nub once we're done scrubbing the floor with these goblins.


The Princess gives Iron-Tail a tired smile. She notes Iron-Tail's plate armor.
That... would be most wonderful.
Thank you... my knight in shining armor.

Okay, just us three.

Onager, guard the left entrance. I'll take the right entrance.

Iron-Tail, we'll support you as you explore. blast anything that moves.

Onager nods in acknowledgement and moves to the left entrance with an arrow knocked.

You don't have to tell me twice. Let's go see what these goblins have been hoarding.


Hefting up her sword and nodding to the princess to reassure her, Iron starts for the mysterious blue lights.

With Princess Carmine safe and out of the beach, the 3 enter.
Iron-Tail goes in, with Yarl at her right side. She can see more in the dark, after all.

The moment the party enters, everything falls silent.
The sound of the waves crashing along the sand and shores simply disappear. There is only a faint humming, and every so often a crackling sound.
The smell. Gods damned the smell.

All around the three are piles of bodies and rotten food.
Bodies of every kind sit in piles, all along an altar.
It looks like some sacrificial alter to...
**The statue that sits in the water**.


![[MechaWater.jpg]]

The statue isn't a statue at all; It's some kind of humanoid machine.

Iron-Tail furrows her brows at this contraption.
Yes, this is a machine.
But it looks so old, yet new.

The group investigates closer, bathed in the flickering blue light that emanates from the cracks of this rusted creation.![[TheMech1.png]]

My gods... That's no statue.
Iron-Tail, it's like you. It's like *knight armor.*

More than that. It's like a titan or vehicle of some sort. I can see why the goblins are attracted to it, but this is something else. It's like the first herald engine block I worked on... Brimming with potential and purpose.

...I have no idea what this thing is.

You're the engineer here.

What should we do?

Something like this doesn't deserve to rust away in a dank cave for goblins to sacrifice maidens to. We're taking this.

Taking it? How? We don't have the horses to pull it.

Show me what this thing can do, if it's a vehicle.

It's got to be human shaped for a reason, and I think that reason is locomotion. Lemme get in there and mess around.

Yarl nods.

Iron Tail makes her way to the vehicle.

Iron-Tail wades through the water, looking for some kind of button or lever, anything that well get it to do something.

Iron Tail touches the statue.
A light blips. at the point of contact.
The light expands in all directions like a ripple of water, all along the titan's exterior. It looks like white and blue veins, pulsating.
The statue shakes and creaks and shifts about
Layers of rust, stone, and moss break off from the titan as it comes to life.

All the foods, the tributes and the treasures placed precariously upon it fall down into the clear waters beneath.

The sound of whirring and grinding echo off the stone walls, like gears of a steam generator.

Iron-Tail takes a step back, an arm covering head from the falling coins.

T¶- ♣ç~{☻»` ~27- ☻`6 {¶- 7¶2♦ ♦☻7 2`. T¶- 7{☻]- 7*-]] 2+ 2]6 \--~ ]»`☺-~7.

It speaks a strange, guttural language.

A burst of activity.
The statue’s limbs start moving.
The statue's torso shoots out with a blast of gas.

It swings up like a knight's helmet visor, sitting atop it.
A putrid smell is emitted as a rotten corpse falls out.
Before anyone can react, **yellow tendrils shoot out and wrap around Iron Tail**.

It pulls her into a seat built into its frame.

The seat adjusts to fit her perfectly, with metal bands securing her limbs to the machine. handholds popping up just where she needs them.

hot and humid air meets her face, then slowly the airflow becomes cold and dry. There is still the matter of the putrid liquefied slimy remains that Iron tail can feel and smell on her clothes and armor.
A panel in front of her slides open, revealing a reflective surface that displays the area around her, kind of like a magical shield spell.
Looking through this mirror, Iron Tail sees her companions from a new angle high up. Onager is for once, looking up at her. 


***From this height, as if she’s become the machine itself.***
The machine feels like it's reading your mind in terms of anticipating your movements. You are enveloped in it. As if the machine is the waters of a bathhouse, and you're floating in the water with only your head tilted back, face exposed to air.
It feels relaxing and safe. 
But the smell of the previous tenant keeps you on edge.

## **Iron-Tail!?**

@Onager#283776  , this thing just ate Iron-Tail! With those yellow tentacles!

Yarl finds a rock to flank to, and arms another alchemist fire bottle to throw.

Wait no! I'm still in there! It reeks of decomposing bodies but otherwise I'm fine.It's almost like I've become one with the machine. It's actually quite comfy once you block the 
smell out.

Yarl stays behind cover.
Iron-Tail's voice is amplified. The lights of the statue flicker with each word she speaks.

You're the statue now?

Can you move around in it?

Say the word if you need help out!

We can smash it to bits, take you out like a can opener, the both of us!


Lemme try it.
Iron-Tail tries to move one of her hands, like she normally would while outside of the mech.

Moving the hands and arms is no issue. It's almost second nature to Iron-Tail. It simply feels like an extension of her, or when someone casted the enlarge spell on her.

Iron-Tail motions to walk. There's a resistance at her legs, like she's under bed covers.
She kicks them up and out. No good. Still stuck.

She pushes herself from the sand that the titan was buried in and stands tall. Sand and muck dribble off the titan in copious amounts.

The is a clear line on the titan's body that separates the rust from the pristine metal of the titan. The metal looks like brass, but does not have that certain visible property of brass.

Standing at full height, Iron-Tail bumps the machine's head on the cave roof. 
A boulder and some debris drops, splashing into the shallow waters underneath her and the machine.

Oh, lords above!

She can feel a *hundred* little buttons at many points of her body: There's small buttons on her handholds and behind her knuckles. There's giant buttons on the sides of her head, on her shoulders and knees.

The mirror is more like a window. There's little runic symbols at the edges of the window, and more appear when Iron Tail presses on a button.

Iron Tail cannot read the runes.

Yarl
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is... all new to me.
Onager, what's on your mind about this?
@Iron-Tail#283774 Iron-Tail, can you get out? Is there like, a hatch?

@Iron-Tail#283774 Yarl looks to both the entrances that they came into.
It's just not big enough.

Hmm... This thing is simply...
I don't know.
I can't make heads or tails of it, nor what to do about it.
Iron-Tails is obviously well apt for it. Must be from all her time with machines.

It's big... will likely tower over the trees nearby...  What would the kingdoms around make  of it... Where does this thing even come from? Some sort of invasion tool?

...We can't leave it here.

Then there's Kayla.

And the Princess.

And all ***this***.

He gestures to what must be 
## ***100,000 gold pieces of treasures and coins*** 
all around the 3 members of the Caerne.

Yarl shakes his head in frustration, then takes a seat.

...Onager, Iron-Tail. Talk to me. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

I want to hear both of your plans of what we should do with:

1. Getting the princess and the loot back to the castle
2. Taking care of Kaelrith
3. What to do with the Iron Golem they've just found

Let's brainstorm and come up with a solid plan here.

He looks up to the titan and it's many flickering lights.

... I wonder how much money this thing can make us.

Iron looks for an exit switch, not that she was going to have just yet. This simply felt too amazing to leave without fully exploring the options.

I can say least help out with the looting of the gold while I'm here.

I'm sure we can find some containers around here to load up that gold.  I'm happy to load up Frostfoot and walk beside him.

Perhaps we can buy another cart somewhere close.

Yarl looks outside the metal dome. He assesses the situation.

Hmm....


@Iron-Tail#283774 Iron-Tail, can you maybe... *walk on the ocean floor?*
@Iron-Tail#283774 Is that thing sealed like a can?


Iron-Tail does all she can to exit the titan's cockpit. Movement felt natural, so does crouching and moving the hands. Why not getting out of it as well?

She makes motions like taking off a shirt, or maybe simply sitting down on her butt.
Lots of strange symbols on the titan's 'vision' come and go as she presses the many buttons all round her.

*...Nothing. Seems like Iron-Tail is stuck in the titan at the moment.*

She may have better luck later, maybe after a thorough examination of the titan from the outside.

Look's like it's sealed up for now. Maybe once we're out of here I can get a proper look as to how to get out of the mech.

Yarl looks at net gun turret. From where he's standing, there's a visible net gun cartridge.
I have an idea.

#### Treading Home

Hawke, Derby, Kaelrith, Jenna and Princess Carmine are all underneath a lone tree, where the party hitched their horses. Jenna has a low flame in hand, acting as a lamp.

They've set out a blanket. Kaelrith is lying down with a towel over her eyes, writhing in pain with Derby checking up on her.
The princess is on Yarl's horse, examining her torn clothes and injured hand. Hawke stands right by Yarl's horse.

There is a large rhythmic rumbling getting closer and closer to them.

Gods, what is that shaking?

This close to the shore aren't any giants or cyclops, the ground would sink them i-
### *HISS*


Headed towards them, a towering metal statue with something shimmering in Jenna's flame around its neck.


It's just us.
Yarl jogs through the sand to get in front of Iron-Tail and her titan. Onager's just behind them, his darkvision eyes glowing in the edges of the torchlight.


Wh-what is that? A moving castle!?

I don't rightly know myself. It's the first time I've ever seen something like this. It's as big as a giant.

Jenna looks around.
Where's Iron-Tail?

In the bright of Jenna's flame, the titan is mostly visible now.

Seems Iron-Tail, Yarl and Onager has collected up all the gold coins and secured them in chests, then wrapped it all up in a net from the net gun.

There's water falling from the titan's crevices. Seaweeds, crabs, and coral on the titan's shoulders.

Iron-Tail sunk down to ocean level with the cargo and walked up onto shore.


She's uhh....
He gestures to the titan.

I'm in here, Jenna! Still trying to figure out how to get outta here, but I can pilot it pretty well. Turns out that giant statue that the princesses were being sacrificed to was this vehicle!

Jenna approaches the titan, marveling at the sight.
Oh, wow.... we had something like this at the cirque before.
Just... wasn't so *big.*
There's blue writing on it here and there.


Derby. Hawke. How's Kayla?
I'm fine, Yarl.
She doesn't remove the towel from her eyes.

The marvel of modern medicine. She's fairing better, but...

Yarl goes over and removes the towel from Kaelrith's eyes. He's peering down at her.
Can you walk? Ride a horse?

She looks at him annoyed, then looks to Iron-Tail's titan.
Woah.

Focus.
Are you well?

She lifts her head up to look at her body.
Her left arm and leg are wrapped up in white splints and bandages.
There was a moment when my arm bent the other way.
I'm not a doctor but I don't think that should happen.

Derby readjusts his glasses.


The fractures in the left humerus, radius, ulna, femur, and tibia, as well as the coracoid and metapatagium in the wing, have been set with splints and secured with bandages. 

While riding a horse may cause considerable discomfort due to the stress on the fractured bones, including the wing structures, it remains possible. However, transport by cart is strongly recommended, as it will reduce strain on the humeral, femoral, and coracoid regions, allowing for a more stable and less painful recovery.


... I understood cart.
Right. well. then...
In the distance, a faint yellow light shines.
It moves through the night, momentarily disappearing, then reappearing, swaying to and fro.

Speak of deamons. A cart.
Someone here must be a halfling, with this kind of luck.

Hawke, Onager, we're securing that cart.

Hawke, take off and stop them. Me and Onager will follow suit.

Stopping a cart in the middle of the night, just for little ol' me?
Yarl begins to move to the cart, Onager following behind.
Yes.

### The Cart

With a lit torch, the two make their way to the cart on horseback.
Hawke has already pounced his way through the steep cliffs and treeline. His feline eyes shimmering in the dark.

A large gentleman with graying hairs and shabby clothing is driving the cart.

Look, I'm just a humble driver with some late harvest stock, I'd don't got no gold for a highwayman.

Hawke is cleaning out his claws.
Bud, I'm not a highwayman. I'm... a merchant of sorts.

How's the deal going, Hawke?

Hey, partner.
As you can see, I've arranged the meeting that you requested with a coachman.

Good evening, traveller.
Are these your own goods or are you transporting on someone else's behalf?

The cart driver's eyes widen upon seeing Onager on Frostfoot.
To him, Onager's practically a giant, with a stranger new breed of superhorse.

Rest assured, we mean you no harm.

Th-This is my- the cart's - y-yes.

...and what profit had you hoped to secure with these goods?

If I had to say, 15 gold peices? a few silvers on top?

What's the haul?

A f-few bolts of fabric, some bags of carrots. potatoes.

Yarl looks to Onager.
Show me what you learned from dealing with those merchants with Iron-Tail.

...and where may I ask are you headed to sell your goods?

Headed t-to Vermillion.


We are in need of aid.  One of our companions is injured and unable to ride a horse.  If we were to pay you 20 gold, would you be willing to drive us to Carmine Reach with our companion in your cart and sell your goods there?  We can offer our services to keep you, your cart, and your goods secure free of charge, throughout the journey as well.

He looks Onager up and down, then his gigantic steed, then towards Yarl and Hawke.

The gears are turning in his head. He's slowly getting more relaxed.

...20 gold?
You and them, keeping the way safe?

That is my offer.
Well, hot damn, you've got yourself a deal.
He gets off the carriage to shake Onager's hand.

Alright, take me to em. I'll need some help moving a few things around, but I think I can accommodate you folks.

Follow me.
Yarl takes a quick pace, guiding the wagon on horseback to the rest of the party.

Hawke approaches Onager.
He's walking alongside a safe distance from Frostfoot.

@Onager#283776 Fine silver tongue you got there, friend.

If I were as big as you, I've just simply strong armed him. Taken the cart.

"Might makes Right" as my kin would say.
Can an Orc relate to a Leonin, in that fashion?

Might often makes hate as well.  Sometimes its not worth the hassle.

That uhh....
That something you learn from the force?
He looks at your uniform.

Yes.  I had commanding officers in the force that often tried to use my size to their advantage.  It never felt right.  Particularly given the circumstances under which they sought to employee it.

A cheeky grin emerges from Hawke's whiskered lips.

And here I thought all Orcish were the same.

**Hawke's opinion of Onager has changed!**

The party gather up.
Those who can ride horses on their own do so.
Everyone moves the farmer's wares around and makes it comfortable for Kaelrith and Princess Carmine.

The Caerne begins to ride off towards Carmine Reach.

Still fumbling with the mecha's escape, Iron-Tail has no choice but to act as the vanguard while still in her titan.

Surprisingly, the titan isn't as loud as its size would allude to. It's no more louder than a convoy of caravans. 
It's just notably slower.

Everyone is positioned on all sides of the cart so that they can speak to each other comfortably.

Let's see, let's see;

We came in, rescued the princess, made off with a fortune just from *goblins*, and find ourselves in ownership of some metal golem that no one seems to have seen before. And when we get back to the castle, our reputation will only grow after the king receives us.
I'm sure the events of today will be solidified in Anna's influence and bardsong.

Kayla may need the services of a clergy. She seems to be the only one this hurt.

But now we've many questions.
Where's the golem from? and what about that deep, almost orcish battle yell in the middle of battle?
...And what do we do with all this gold?

Derby looks to the chests of gold that's slung over the horses, in the cart, as well as on the back of the titan.

What do we do with it?
I say whatever we want.

You've got enough money to do *the thing* now.

You could... start another group if you want.
Or get a castle of your own!

I'm making a rough estimate of all the trinkets and golden chandeliers. They're a bit dirty, yeah, but a little spit and polish, it would sell nicely.

Something like, 100,000 gold?

That's something like 2 castles.

Not enough for a palace, but maybe a few trading posts.


You could quit this life. No more merc management.

... *Is that what I want?*

Still unsure of his own safety, the driver is keeping his mouth shut.

Is this much metal really get you 2 castles?

{Errm, Milady, what can 10 gold get you, do you think?}

Hmmmm.... I would say one of daddy's ales?

... You don't leave home too often do you, Milady?

Oh, almost never! Daddy says that it's a dangerous world out there, and I should stay in the courtyard with the other nobles where it's safe.

Then how did you find yourself in this ...predicament?

Oh... I...

She blushes as she looks down.

I was...
...
I... I followed a *boy.*

He said he was a noble's son. A military school boy at the cusp of graduating.

He told me that 'someone as precious as me' should let out more. And offered to take me to the commoner's square under a hood. No one was to find us until later that night.

...Milady, may I ask your age? I understand that aging is different for half-elves as it is for the other races.
I myself am 15 years old, but come from a place where I needed to mature *quick*.

And you are...?

I'm 44.

I see.

Anyway, I'm with the boy... and around the time the town lamplighters started to make their rounds, someone pulled the hood down on my head, I felt little hands grope all around me. They threw me in a burlap bag, and... I was there. In that cage.


And you were there until we found you?

Oh, it was awful! I couldn't stomach the trash the big one served me.

At some point I was so scared, I backed up and put my hand out of the cage.

One of the green things just...

She looks at her injury.

...It was like a dog gnawing on a bone. Like it hadn't eaten for days.

She looks to the distance with a thousand-mile stare.

OOkayyyy, interrogation over.

This 'boy' needs to be found.

Agreed. Milady, what does he look like? Anything we can go on?

Boss. No more questions.

Later then.
Yarl nods.

She stares out, deaf and blind to the events around her.

The party agrees to remain quiet and keep an eye out for any trouble. Traveling at night. There is no one else who pass the group.
They even pass the abandoned Inn with no issue.


## Entering Carmine Reach


Passing over a grassy hill, the many lamps of Carmine Reach shine brightly in the night.

As the group get closer, the many checkpoint soldiers at first raise arms towards the titan.

A horn is heard, and a fire beacon is lit.

Halt. State your business and explain this... metal giant you have in your possession.


Yarl of the Caerne Merc Group. Hired by King Carmine to retrieve a VIP. He gestures to the cart. Princess Carmine waves to the Red Kingdom soldier.

Iron-Tail waves towards the checkpoint guards and tries to look as non threatening as possible given the circumstances.

Hello there! There's a person piloting this metal giant. A person who's currently trying to figure out how to get out of the thing, actually.

The boom of Iron-Tail's voice startles the soldiers.

It's new to me as it is to you.
Your superior informed you, yes? A group to return with...?

The handful of soldiers talk quietly amongst each other. One clears his throat.

You're fine to pass.

A complex horn signal blares out.
The fire pyre is then quenched.

In sequence, the pyres of the other checkpoints go out.

The soldiers just stare in wonder as Iron-Tail walks through.

Ohmygods, Iron-Tail, you're gonna be ***famous!***
Maybe I can try the titan? When you get out?

If I get out, we'll see if anyone else can pilot this thing.
They make their way through the road. When the dirt road becomes cobblestones, The Caerne go to hitch their horses.

We're not leaving you with the horses, Iron-Tail. come along.
The titan is crushing the occasional cobblestone tile as they make their way to the castle steps.

At the steps, with 4 nobles and servants, stands **King Carmine** himself.
He's a human man with a red-jeweled crown on his head, and silken clothing.

The princess rushes to hug him.

As they have an intimate talk with each other, the nobles create a barrier that separates the Caerne from the king and princess.

...And what is that?
The nobles gesture to the titan.

{Lords, we're gonna get this question a lot} We found it when we found the princess. Our engineer recovered it.


**The Caerne will spend this day unbothered. Tomorrow on the morning we will have a feast within the royal court, in their honor.**


The nobles offer their congrats.
The sun is beginning to set.
It has been 2 days since they rescued the princess.

Ah, Anna, you're here.
The Caerne's resident herald appears. She stands elegantly at the top of the castle stairs.
She curtsies.

Anna quietly walks down the stairs. She's close enough to the titan to touch it.
She whispers to herself.
Floating lights appear around her. The familiar blue arcane veins once again appear along the titan.

The titan shakes. gasses hiss and shoot out. cogs and gears turn.
The torso opens up and forcefully ejects Iron-Tail out.
Everyone can smell the decay coming from inside the cockpit.

...Anna, how did you
She brings a finger to her lips.

{We must speak later, Yarl of the Coven.}

Iron-Tail is now outside of the titan.
She smell and looks haggard, having not been able to get out of the thing for 2 days. She is tired, hungry, and thirsty.

Noble
Your rooms have been prepared and stocked with a light meal, as per Anna's instruction. Please, rest well. We have much to discuss.

The party heads to their quarters.

Once Iron-Tail was ejected out of the titan, she breathes a sigh of relief as she desperately tracks down the nearest source of food and water. As she devours plate after plate of food and glass after glass of water, she barely even notices that strange armband on her wrist. Nor does she notice the titan glimmer away in a flash of blue light, which trails into said armband. Once she's finished gorging herself, she finally notices the armband, and starts playing around with the controls.

Jenna tags along with Iron-Tail.

Yarl walks along with Onager.
Through the castle windows, the sky goes from a bright orange down to a purple gradient.

Right.
Take the load off, Onager. Get yourself some rest in your quarters, maybe ask for a bath set up from the servants.

Keep an eye on the others as well until we all reconvene . Make sure we don't do anything to raise issues.
With the mission complete, I'm sure our reputation here will flourish.

The Caerne's Carmine Reach Reputation:
**Well Liked**
Due to previous actions, the people of this settlement enjoy your company. Shopkeepers will wave you in on deals, and some will smile and ask about your day.


I'm going to go find Kaelrith some proper care. Our field medic Derby can only do so much.

It's true. We're always short on the proper equipment for adequate care.

Anna and I will also chat about the next move. It's all... *so much*.

@Onager#283776 What will you do?

I will see that our driver is given a proper introduction so that he might sell his wares.  Then a bath and a long rest in an actual bed would be lovely.

Yarl waves Onager off. He shifts his attention to Kaelrith and Anna.

Okay, Kayla. Where to?

Yarl...
She grabs onto Yarl's sleeve and whispers something in his ear.

They begin to drift away from earshot
{Oh... are you sure? It's been some time since you've seen them.}
{Yes. It will be awkward, but they keep their doors open to anyone. Even me.}

Onager can only really hear a few words now.

{Hm... -Church...}
{Ah... Arbyter...}


Onager follows the signs to the marketplace.


The Marketplace


Jenna has made a few purchases around the markets for herself. It's all non-flammable goods like jewelry, metal trinkets. If there is anything flammable in the things she's bought, she keeps them in a doubled-up fabric bag.

...It's the elephant in the room! The skeleton in the closet! It's writing on the wall!

The ***gold***, my dear Iron-Tail! *So much of it!*

We're made girls, you and me! divied up 10, 20 ways, that's still *so much gold*. I've never seen that much gold in all my time at the carnival!

This is our first big girl mission, and it's practically our last! We're set to retire!

She makes large, dramatic movements and gestures with lovely expressions. Each movement feels rehearsed. Mastered.
You remember that The Caerne hired her from a travelling carnival troupe.

I can see it now...
With all this money, I can buy land from a noble. Become a baroness!
Or live comfortably with other Emberkin! My cousins, or one of the few who also came from the portal.

So much potential in those shiny little discs. Reading lessons! Some kind of magic item to cool my flames down.

I can't wait for Yarl to give us our share. I assume it will be tomorrow, after his talk with that Elven woman. Anna.

She looks around, eyes shining with wonder and hope. The merchants can't help but stare at her. Jenna the Flamedance is simply glowing with life.

What's on your mind, Iron-Tail? The gold? The mech? The town? Dish!

Oh, that's right. Now's the perfect time to work on a *thingy* for the princess.
You'll be seeing her at the feast tomorrow.

Her eyes travel everywhere, gazing at the many clothing articles on display all around.

**Ugh.** I wish I had that money *now*. But then again, all these dresses don't suit me. I'm just.. *too hot. *

She lightly elbows Iron-Tail on the sides of her full belly.
Ahahahaha!

...Seriously, though. I wish I could buy these lovely dresses. It would burn in minutes.
I figure I can buy one and copy the pattern, but I don't have enough fabric to make one. 
I'd have to go back home to get more from my family.

She pokes at Iron-Tails' armband.

It's rather cute, for what it can do.

Jenna is talking a mile a minute.

**Jenna is comfortable to be herself around Iron-Tail!**

It certainly does make for a very fashionable piece of technology, even if it can summon a giant magical construct more than twice my height. But yes, we've hit quite the windfall given the circumstances. Who knew goblins could be so profitable?

Iron-Tail was lugging around a bag full of cleaning supplies and air fresheners so that she could clean out the mech the next time that she enters. She might end up going to town on it tonight.

Where do you think it came from?
You think this is some kind of...
New age Goblin technology?

The immediate thought of inbred humanoids living in caves amongst their own filth crosses Iron-Tail's mind.
I mean...  *could be.*

I somehow doubt they made that metal giant. The way they were worshipping it, I doubt that they understood what they were dealing with. Besides, didn't it stark speaking in elvish? Can't imagine they spoke it.

So, Elven tech?
Hmmm....

She ponders this while browsing market stalls.
Elves are usually so private. They're so rare, and stick together like glue.

If you want more info about that giant-

She taps the armband

You'll have to ... ask our bard, **Anna**.

Orrrrr the **Princess of Carmine Reach**. Poppa Carmine looked human. And the princess is half... Obviously the mom's an elf.

You *did* promise the princess a little something for her missing pinky.

Jenna finds a disguise kit, and puts on a fake beard and a wooden crown.

Sir Knight...

Are you not a paragon of honestly? A hero who's pledge is as sure as the sun and stars?

You have made promise to Kingspawn with the gods as witness!

She walks about with a curtain as a robe and the expression of royalty

Are you not what you appear to be, Iron-Tail?

Are you not...
A Knight of the CaernnnnNNnnnNne??!

Does my armor not glean with the resolve of a mercenary? Does the sword art my hilt not seek out my foes with righteous fervor? If I am not a knight of the Caerne, then show me someone in this crowd who is worthy of the title!

Jenna brushes her fake beard in a show of her decades of kingly wisdom.

(falsetto low voice)

It is as you say, Iron-Tail of the Caerne.
Yours is a blade that will *pierce the heavens.*
Go forth. Slay swampy swamp beasts in the name of the Red Kingdoms.

Produce a mechanical pinky finger fit **only** for my royal daughter.

As for a worthy examples amongst the market crowds...

(Loud falsetto voice)

### *...Is there no one worthy?*

## **HEY!**
The shopkeep approaches.

You're burnin' up the merchandise! You're paying for the damages, or I call the guards!

Jenna looks at the wares she grabbed for her fun.
It's true. the fake beard and robe are singed black.
*S-Sorry!*
She takes it all off and meekly hands the shopkeep a few silvers.
She then grabs Iron-Tail's hand and leaves in an embarrassed rush.
{Let's get out of here, girlie!}
The two girls rush to find materials for the mechanical finger.

Iron Tail finds all the parts she needs to craft a mechanical appendage. Iron-Tail uses the metal that's she's scavenged to craft a mechanical appendage for the princess. Obviously, she wanted it to be functional, serving as something that could attach to her nub and replicate the functions of the pinky she lost. But being that she was a princess, Iron wanted to add a few embellishments to really make it pop. This wasn't just a prosthetic, this was an accessory in it's own right. She engraves flowery imagery and lots of flourishes into the device to remind her that though she lost a part of her pinky, she was not lesser for it.

Outside of the Girl's view, Onager enters the marketplace.

## The Driver's Wares

Onager spots the driver from before. A large man. Graying hairs and shabby clothing.
He's peddling his wares using his cart as a makeshift display table.

It's bolts of fabric, a few bags of carrots and potatoes. They're all laid out on edge of the cart.
There looks to be fewer bags and bolts of goods than what Onager remembers. He's made a few sales.

He's got a satisfied look to him as he watches the marketplace crowd slowly dissipating.
He catches Onager's eye.

At first the driver's startled. Then he nods to Onager, then keeps his attention to the good browsers.


I wanted to thank you again for agreeing to drive us here and I apologize that we weren't forthcoming about having the princes among us.  Our injured companion is hopefully receiving the aid we sought this very moment.

The driver nods appreciatively to the Half-Orc Investigator.

I won't lie to you, I thought it was a robbery.
First, a Leonin appears in the nighttime, blocking the way, then an Orc and an armor-clad fighter emerges from the darkness as a group?

You'd do the same, in my shoes.

This place is a bit farther than Vermillion, but I'm still selling my wares all the same.
Figures that fabric, carrots and potatoes are needed wherever you go.

He leans against his cart comfortably.

...The princess you say?
Of Carmine Reach?

Hmmm. I figured she was royalty, what, with the whole "Milady, Milady" business, along with the royal dress.

...

But you never know with people nowadays. Could'a been a commoner pretending to be royalty for kicks. You know how it can be.But you never know with people nowadays. Could'a been a commoner pretending to be royalty for kicks. You know how it can be.

Your injured companion...
The bird? or the half-elf?

Ahhhh it don't matter to me none. Thanks to you, I got paid. With all this gold, I don't need to know much else.

He nods quietly to himself, thinking about all the gold he's made in a single day.

Yes, Princess of Carmine Reach.  Our avian companion was wounded freeing her from her goblin captors.

He nods.

The princess of Carmine Reach, in my very own cart....
If I had known, I would have cleaned up a bit! Aaaa hahahahaha!

Onager
...and The Caerne's March guarding it!

Reminds me of a time when I went fishing. Some kind of bird nabbed the trout right from my line! Let me tell you the story:

So there I am, in a canoe...
The driver begins a long tale of how his catch was taken by a local bird-of-prey.

 I was down at the creek, fishin’ for my supper.
Had me a fine line, nothin' fancy, but I’d had luck with it before. Wasn’t in no rush—just sittin' there, lettin’ the water do its thing, when I feel this tug.
## A big one, too.

Nearly yanked the rod right outta my hands.

I wrestled with it for a good bit, and sure enough, up comes the fattest trout I ever laid eyes on.

Belly all white, scales glistenin’ in the sun, a real beauty.
I’m standin’ there, grinnin’ like a fool, thinkin’ about how I’ll fry it up nice with some butter, maybe a sprig o’ rosemary if the missus has any left.
Then -*outta nowhere*- swoosh!
This blasted falcon—big ol’ thing with wings wider than my shed—comes barrelin' outta the sky.
Snatches the trout right off my line like it was his all along. Didn’t even give me a second to holler. Just up and gone, flappin’ off with my dinner danglin' from its claws.

He shakes his head in disappointment.

Ain’t been fishin' since.
Figure if the birds are that hungry, I best stick to plantin' taters where the sky can't steal ‘em.

Onager smiles at the tail.

Perhaps I owe this bird a debt of gratitude for turning your focus to potatoes and your need to sell them at market!


Yessir, I guess you could say that!
He laughs wholeheartedly

I'll leave you to your sales.  Best wishes and happy travels!

Yessir, yessir! Much appreciated!
He waves you off.

Oh, and about your avian friend!
Best of luck to that one! Heard they got them hollow bones!
Fast to break, fast to fix, from what I hear!

Thank you.  I'll pass that along when I visit her.

He gives you a thumbs up.
The both of you slowly disappear from each other's view in the marketplace.

## Chambers


Time passes.

Onager and Iron-Tail retire to their chambers.
In their own rooms, Onager and Iron Tail awake to birdsong in their chambers.

Not too long ago, Iron-Tail was knighted after defeating an acid beast.

Not even a year, and Onager had left the city watch because of bureaucrats who dealt in shady dealings.

And now they awoke to the softest silk bed linens they've ever felt, after rescuing the princess of a local kingdom.

With a *feast in their honor.*

So much as happened:
- There was the fire that killed that one fat mercenary.
- That noble that Derby knew from his past service in the war.
- The Caerne uprising, with Torgon the Half-Orc Veteran.
- The hanging of Torgon.
- Jenna and the night out.
- The carnival and the trashed campsite.
- The Princess Rescue Mission
- The Goblins and the Mountains of Gold
- Kaelrith's health
- The Titan in Iron-Tail's armband and 'The Perfect Champion'
- Anna and her ties with the titan
- The Driver
- The Feast

To think it all happened in *one spring.*
Who knows how the summer will be.

A knock at the door.

Hey. It's Yarl.
It's time for the feast. We'll all walk together to the dining hall as 'The Caerne'.

It's all just for show. Give the nobles something to gossip about. Get our name out.

Everyone gets ready. The party is in their best attire, as requested by Yarl.

As Onager and Iron-Tail come out, they see The Caerne's leader, Yarl, dressed in the stereotypical nobleman clothing;
 a restrictive blue dress shirt embossed with many buttons and designs in every corner of the attire.
I know, I know, It's not my style. Unfortunately this is Anna's domain. If we're to get the good gigs, this is a necessity.

Anna is calmly walking about, examining every Caerne member's attire. She approaches Onager and Iron-Tail.

Jenna is wearing an ornate headdress, a tube top that wraps around her chest that reveals the her muscular form and ashen complexion, baggy silken pants that stop at her knees, and pointy shoes.
This is the noble clothing of my culture. It's a little revealing yes, but it means a great deal to us Flame Genasi. A testament to the past and where we've come from.


Kaelrith makes an appearance.
Her affected side is wrapped in gauze and splints.
She's wearing white clothing bearing the symbol of some religion that is on the tip of Onager and Iron-Tail's tongue...

*(Gasp)*
Kaelrith!
You're...


Alive?
It was the will of the gods. Someone has to watch over this band of misfits.

How's the, ahhh...
The mortal shell?

Derby makes an appearance, holding onto a pair of crutches. Derby has taken off his trademark blue tie and coat, instead donning a white formal suit that resembles Yarl's attire.

As described by the local shamans and my medical colleagues, Kaelrith's avian collar structure has been compromised to the point of fragility.
The fracture extends through the coracoid and scapular bones, which are essential for stabilizing the flight muscles. The damage is particularly severe near the shoulder girdle, where the pectoralis major, responsible for wing flapping, is tethered. 

Extensive scar tissue has formed, limiting flexibility, and any attempt at full extension of the wing causes unbearable strain on the weakened bone structure. Additionally, the left humeral joint sustained ligament tears, making even basic movement arduou-

### **I can't fly anymore.**

Derby remains silent.

Jeez, just rip the bandage off, doc.
The money's not the issue. There's regeneration magic and potions for this.
The problem is *where to find the clerics for this.*
They've either been killed in the war, imprisoned, in hiding, or all of the above.

...

I'm sure we'll find some sort of cure for you, pet.
Don't call me that, Hawke.

He playfully *rawrs* at Kaelrith.
Hawke is dressed in similar attire to Anna; Elven clothing, save for green ruffle collar.

Oh.. Hawke... You're...
Hawke sighs.
If you *must know*...
I was adopted by an Elven family when I was a child.
If nobility is to display one's social rank in one's society, then this shall be what I am to be adorned in.

No no, it's... you're...
*Sho cuteeeee*

Jenna puts on gloves from her clasp bag and rubs Hawke's face.

Surprisingly, Hawke simply stands there with a frown and lets it happen.

Anna beams at Hawke and nods. She approves of the Catfolk's attire.

Derby moves to hand Kaelrith her crutches.

Yarl intervenes.
He gently takes Kaelrith's good arm.
She leans her weight into him.

Leave the crutches here, Doc. She'll be in my charge until the feast is over.

Derby nods.
Are we all ready?

Let's roll out. Anna?
Anna bows her head and quietly guides The Caerne to the dining hall.

## Dining Hall

It was a slow walk from their guest chambers to the dining hall.
Excitement all around them as the servants make last minute preparations. People are pouring in and out from all directions dressed in the latest fashions.

Anna bypasses the large crowd forming in front of the hall entrances. She leads the team to a small side entrance where they are met by a halfling woman.

Ah. The Herald. You're all here, I suppose?
Yes, we are.
She stops in her verbal tracks and casts Yarl a surprised look.
...Oh. It's Yarl of the Caerne.
I've heard a few of your exploits.

Yarl fixes his hair and adopts a confident gait.
None too disappointing, I hope?

She blushes.
Anna discreetly tugs at Yarl's sleeve.

We're a bit tied up at the moment, but when time permits, I'll tell you the true events of those adventures you've heard.
Now. We are to be...?

She guides the team into the dining hall, through the king's lane.

The dining hall might as well have been a temple.
A tall ceiling easily 100 feet tall with a mural of the King's ancestors, fighting off many invaders all throughout the castle's history.
The morning light descends to the tens of dining tables lined with white linens.
It's a spacious and well lit room, with the faintest echoes bouncing off the stone walls.

You could hear the king whisper from his dining hall throne and it would sound like he was right next to you.

Daddy, they're here!

The king and princess of Carmine Reach make an appearance. They must have been only a few steps behind them.

The Princess is in finer clothing than what she had worn during her capture.
From the top down:
 Her hair has been cleaned, shampooed, oiled and combed to perfection then left to flow with the wind. It has an unnatural airiness to it, as if lighter than air.

 This tiara looks to be a different one than before, as this one's jewels complements the princess's blue eyes.

Her red dress is ornate with gold accents and adornments.

She rushes over to greet the girls of the group.

Oh my! Jenna, I didn't know you were royalty! Your outfit is lovely!

Oh- n-no, I'm not royalty, milady. But th-this is aristocratic outfit of my people.

She puts her hand on her necklace and sighs while looking at the members of the Caerne.
As far as I'm concerned, you're all royalty to me.

Have you been well, milady?

She pouts at this.
*I shall hear no more of this 'milady this, milady that' farce.*
You and those of the Caerne Mercenary group shall henceforth call me by the name given to me by my Elven lineage.

Adalithiel o Tirion Carnin.

Or simply **Adalithë**.

He bows.

As you wish.
Adalithe.

Normally I would be against such casual greetings from commoners.

The king takes a step into the conversation.

Despite the long gray hairs with the occasional streak of black, The King looks youthful.
Healthy sun kissed skin. Pearly white teeth. An ox's frame standing just a bit taller than Yarl. Muscles visible through the thin silk of his kingly robes.

The only dead giveaway to his age is the crow's feet of his eyes and his slow, measured walk.

... But nobility is synonymous with 'those of character and honor'.
You have earned the right to mingle with the princess as she sees fit.

I thank you, father.

He nods.

Come. Sit. Tea, coffee, ales or wines, whatever you wish and it shall be brought.

There are servants at the edge of the room on standby.


We have much to discuss, Yarl. The princess will be seated to my left; The Leader of the Caerne, my right.

Adalithe grabs Iron-Tail by the hand and Jenna by the bag.

Come, my knight. You're to sit with me. Nowhere safer than in the charge of the two of you.

Yarl gently leads Kaelrith to sit next to Jenna.
He then walks to the other side of the table and extends Anna's seat for her so that Anna is sitting next to him.

Everyone orders their drink of choice.
Yarl - Pilsner Lager
King Carmine - Wine in a custom crystal wine glass. It's labeled 'megapint'.
Anna - Tea with milk
Adalithe - Citron Tea
Derby - Coffee
Kaelrith - Black Tea
Hawke - Milk

Now...
*Tell me of the events that led to the capture of my daughter.*

The party begins to recount the events of the goblin infestation to the king.
It's mostly Yarl doing the heavy talking.

--------------------------

I see, I see...
She was lured out by some infiltrator...
... Worshiping some sort of mechanical giant?

Someone taught them how to use old siege engines. Took me right out of the sky.

Iron-Tail was sipping a cup of coffee, with plenty of sugar and milk in it as the king and Yarl recounted the events of the goblin seige.

Apparently, your daughter wasn't the only princess that was offered up to that statue, to say nothing of the massive amounts of gold and other treasures we carted away.

And this giant...
That was the statue last night. With the glowing veins.

King Carmine puts a hand to his face.
*Not the only princess...*

...Did you see their bodies? How many were there?

Can't say that I saw any other bodies. I probably would have gagged if I did.

hmmm...

I'll have to ask the other Red Kingdoms about this.
Are you sure there was another Red princess?


Poppa, I was the one who told her about the other princess.

And you're sure? Was she a princess from Alizarin? Sangria? Vermillion?

I didn't have the chance to talk to her, but yes, I'm sure. I remember seeing her at a Gala you've hosted here. But that was decades ago.

...

I'll have to ask around. send pigeon to the other red domains.

Was there anything else you saw there?

Well, there was the giant metallic orb covered in elvish that seemed to cover the entryway to the cove. That's where we found the princess.

The mercenary band hasn't encountered anything like it before. Easily 30 feet tall, 30 feet wide, with embossed runes all over it.

To call the symbols Elvish though...

Yarl looks to Anna.

She is quietly sipping her tea in a lovely ceramic teacup. Her eyes are closed as she enjoys the flavor of it.

She sets it down and begins to speak.

Once again, all the sounds around her are muffled.

***...It is... 
Elvish from thousands of years ago.***

...

... *So what?* Elves like you live for thousands of years. You say it like it's old. It's probably younger than you.

No.
Elves live a long time yes, but it's centuries, at most just the one, singular thousand. Anna said thousands.

How old do you think, Anna?

She sets her teacup down. Then traces her fingers in the air, leaving white glowing Elvish text floating in the air.

*This is modern Elvish for 'The golden warrior'.
My people preserve our written language well, but we too, are slaves to time. The script changes with every author, from letter to letter.
Straight lines become curved.*

She begins to bend some of the lines of the sentence, removing dashes and dots.

*This is the script present on Iron-Tail's Bond. The 'titan' as you put it.*

Soooo a couple thousand?

...*Seven... Nine Millennia.*

And it just... works? after 7000 years, it just opens up at random?

*This is lost Elven technology. My assertion with its age is an educated guess.*

You know more than you're letting on.

You opened it and let Iron-Tail out.

Anna takes a sip of tea and remains silent. She looks to Yarl from the corner of her eye.

...Where is this bond, this titan, now?

...It's within our care.

That's a way to put it but yes. Rest assured, we have it in a secure location.
Iron-Tail wasn't sure if Yarl was being defensive for her sake or just generally given the circumstances. But she was going to follow along with it.


King Carmine looks to Iron-Tail.

And you are... the driver of the titan?
I remember it so. When your bard released you from its belly. You were the one in armor.

There's no mistaking that tail.

...What did it feel like? Did you feel like you were... a moving castle of some sort?

A dog howl can be heard from the open window nearby

It felt like a second skin or sorts. All of my movements felt completely natural, like riding a swampwader. A giant, metallic, humanoid swampwader, but you get the picture.

King Carmine leans back on his throne, taking a mega gulp of wine.

...what if... 
we were to craft a weapon for you?

In the same size as your titan.

Would you be able to fight with it?

You've got the capabilities to make something like that? If it's as easy to maneuver as the one we've got right now, then sure!

He smiles.
We've plans for you yet, Knight of the Caerne.
He signals for a servant.

A servant promptly pours more wine into the King's carafe, separate from his crystal glass.

I am grateful to have sent out a band as capable as The Caerne to retrieve my daughter in one piece.

Well... the larger piece.

For this, I thank you all. I see that some sacrifices were made.

He raises a glass to the Ownlin Kaelrith.
She returns the gesture and raises her drink with her good arm.

I must depart. The knowledge you've given me has made substantial changes in my plans. I must council for the future of Carmine Reach.

For these few moments, before the feast, I am at your service.

What questions to answer, what acts, may ***sovereignty*** do for you?

My thanks for your generous hospitality your highness but, I have no questions and ask for nothing you haven't already graciously given.

He looks to everyone else.

Ah that reminds me. In lieu of your missing bit, I'd like to present to you a prosthesis pinky!

Iron-Tail presents the mini member to the princess in a small wedding ring box that she repurposed for the tiny engraved digit that she made using those parts she found.

I only hope that it is to your liking, princess.

Oh, my...
She takes it and examines it.

It's... the flowers and the flourishes...

She puts the box on the table and puts it on.
With a flex of her nub, the metallic appendage articulates. It's as if the pinky was never lost in the first place.


It's lovely. I love it!

She takes Iron-Tail's hand in hers.

First you take me from danger, and with this you take my heart.

One day soon, you'll make someone very happy, knight.

She lets go, examining the intricacy of her new appendage.

{Good stuff, Girlie!}


Right. I'm off then.
I shall summon The Caerne sometime soon after council.
He nods, then heads through the king's entrance.

### Servants! Begin the feast! The Princess shall take charge!


At once, the servants begin to travel every which way.

The distant guards at the entrance doors of the dining hall open. Servants of all dress are guiding in the many nobles and merchant to their seats.

Soon, the food is served.

Princess Adalithe Carmine is making rounds, greeting those she knows with hugs while shaking the hands of new friends and partners.

It's an impressive spread. Turkey legs, mashed potatoes, sauteed carrots, boar on a spit, pigs in a blanket, it's all here.

A toast!

To the princess's safe return!

### Here here!
                           {here here!}
here here!

{A bag of coins says the people here didn't even know she went missing until this morning...}

After some time, there is live music, dancing, and a small show of theatrics for the guests.

Oh, I know these performers! They're torch turners!
...Anna can't be the only one putting our good names out for our benefit.
I'll be right back.

She takes off with a turkey leg in hand. The smell of roasted turket follows Jenna as her bare hand cooks the leg further.

She talks with the performers who greet her with smiles and praise.
Soon, she is performing with them, throwing fireballs where need be.

...We've assembled quite the band, haven't we Anna? Kayla?

Anna gives a lovely smile as she slowly saws at her pizza with a knife and fork.

...They're a good bunch. A lot better than Torgon and them. And the big one, the greedy fathead. What was his name?

Rupert.

You're blessed for your memory, Yarl.

Yarl motions for Iron-Tail and Onager to take the seats close to him, Anna and Kaelrith.

Hey. We have to talk. About the future of the band.

### Hawke, you want in on this or not? It's a bit important. Now or later is fine.

### Later then!

He's indisposed, talking to some girls who look to be about 16 or so, close to Hawke's 15 years.

{Ugh, the little player. He reminds me of me, when I was young.}

Right. Listen.

I've been talking to Anna a lot about the recent events that's been playing out in the continent.

He takes the keepsake photo from that one night out and puts in on the table for all to see.

We've been through some interesting times, good and bad.

But this mission has put us in... an interesting position.

The treasure we've recovered is at market, 100,000 gold pieces.
Split it 8 ways between the Caerne, that's 12,500 gold per head, about.

This is 'fuck off' money.

Agreed.
You can live like a king for years off this.
Build a cottage, live a simple life. 
Buy a sailing ship, fuck off to wherever you want to go.
Someone has a problem with you, you have the means to organize for them to 'fuck off'.

*... So why would you stay in the life of a mercenary?*



So long as the mercenary work is GOOD work, I'll continue to do it.

That 'fuck off' money allows us to be more selective about the jobs we take and well consider their greater implications.

@Onager#283776 Agreed, Agreed.


I know I'm not the only one that saw the way King Carmine talked about Iron-Tail's titan.

If I were in his shoes, I'd be thinking about turning the titan into a weapon. To fight the Azul Empire and retake what the Red Kingdoms lost.

This thing that's sleeping in Iron-Tail's arm...
It has too much potential to become a weapon. 
A **powerful** one at that.


...I have something to tell all of you.
...I joined the Caerne for a solution.
For this.
He brushes aside his long hair to reveal the nape of his neck.

There is a festering wound there.
A brand of 3 staves.
My power comes from a promise I made long ago, to a group of witches.
For a short time, I was the quintessential plague to the lands.

'Yarl of the Coven'.

I...

with this much money, I plan to buy everything that I need. Then travel to the edges of the continent and free myself of the three hags.

**Yarl has revealed the source of his magical power! He is a warlock, bound to a coven of witches.**

I...
I plan to leave the Caerne, and give ownership back to Anna.
I didn't plan to be the leader of the band, yet here I am.


Onager... You've been my right hand man.
And Iron-Tail, with the titan answering to you, you're brimming with potential.

You could fight for the Red Kingdoms. You could return to your swamps and uplift your people!

For far too long, I feel like the two of you have been following me in my desires.

I wish to follow my own. And help the both of you towards whatever purpose you've given your lives toward.

I want to know:
***What is your purpose?***

Onager
...Long before I was driven from service, as a very young man, I readily accepted the role of enforcer.  I did many things that looking back, I am ashamed of.  It took a while for me to recognize the evil in my actions and a long while after that to finally stand up for my newfound beliefs.  That was when things soured and I removed myself.  My purpose is to make amends for the small folk I've harmed in my ignorance and willingness to please as a young man and this is my opportunity to do just that.

Yarl
To make right that which is wrong...
That's respectable.
And very much like you, Onager.



Iron-Tail
...I'd be lying if getting the swampland the respect it deserves wasn't a major part of the reason of why I joined up. Not just us ratfolk, but everyone living in the swamps. We've got family, culture, society! Everything that you could find outside the swamps you can find in them! Well, maybe not the giant ass castles, but the point still stands. There's people there, people willing to do anything and everything to make ends meet. I want to make it so my people don't *just* have to make ends meet. I want the swamps themselves to have a seat at the table, and have the means to grow and not just survive, but thrive.

Anna nods.

Hmm.
...sounds like you guys may need to set up shop at Onager's hometown. Or Iron-Tail's swamp.

Hawke returns, with lipstick stains on his neck. He's heard the tail end of your quest.

I have to say, the way you talk about the swamps, it sounds lovely. You've got to take us there.

Oh, and since we're all being honest and such:
I'm quitting the band.
Do you honestly think I'm any help with:
She gestures to her broken wings and arm.

Then you'll return, as you always do, right?

And you, Derby?

I...
He takes his time, thinking of the right words to best convey his plans for himself.
...For now, I wish to continue traveling with the members of the Caerne.
Not so much in a combat capacity, but rather in experimentation and medical breakthroughs.


Hmmm....
### **Jenna!**

Jenna hears Yarl calling for her.

With torch in hand balancing on the other performers, she releases a grand spectacle of different colored flames, then slowly disappears into the crowd and reappears at the Caerne Table.

Yeah, boss?

We're going around asking for our purpose in life.
You got a plan with yours?


Mmmmmmmm.....
To be honest, I've been thinking about just...
taking the money and retiring from this life.
I have family! little cousins to take care of.
You understand, right Iron-Tail?
At any moment, we could get killed in some dark dungeon, thousands of miles away from the closest settlement.
That's...
that's not for me.
That's not the good end for anyone here.

Well, I'm quitting anyway. Busted wing.

Oh? Good for you, Kaelrith.

She nods.

Soooooo yeah. After Yarl distributes the gold, I was gonna stay with my uncle in Vermillion for a bit. Then head home back to the family.

That's a respectable decision. One's life isn't a game, after all.

I'm glad you understand.
Iron-Tail, I want you to visit me when you can.

Only if you come and visit me in the swamplands every once and a while. I can show you around the treetop villages and make you some lotus seed soup.

@Iron-Tail#283774 Oh, mygods i would *love thaaaaaat*

Well I'm in it for the adventure, regardless of reason.
I was made for this life.
Yarl goes and tussle's Hawke's fur.

Oh, my sweet summer child...

Okay, well then that settles that.
I'm glad we had this talk.

Anna? I'm taking my share of the earnings and going off to help my coworkers.

Will you be fine with ownership returning to you?

Anna nods.
*The Caerne existed hundreds of years before you. It will exist for hundreds more when you are no longer.*

Ouch.
Okay, one last question then:
The titan.
King Carmine will for sure want you as a combat asset in the coming wars.

Ehhhh I wouldn't say Iron-Tail specificallyyyyy.
We could give him schematics of the titan. Give him his army and leave the Nezumi out of it.

...It's your armor, Iron-Tail.
How do you want to do this?

See... on one hand, handing the schematics over and letting the king try his best to replicate the designs from that would be preferable to me being at his beck and call every time he wants me to fight for him. I can respect the ambition and the desire to reclaim lands that were once theirs. But at the same time, I get the oddest feeling that they might go a bit overboard with all of this amazing technological power.

Power often corrupts.

Orrrr. You say 'screw it.' And leave in the middle of the night.
@Hawke#283961 {... Do you have the stupid or something?}

There's got to be a reason why this is one of the only relics of a long since forgotten sect of elves... and something tells me that at the other end of it is ruin.


*Your questions can be answered, Nezumi.*
She takes a bite of pizza from her fork in elegance.
*My people are willing to offer much for the Bond you have in your possession.*

Okay, statue, titan, giant, bond, is everyone just making up names for Iron-Tail's dohickey?

*When you've live hundreds of years, language melds and words become one and the same. Shield? Weapon? Items of conflict, really.*

I am aligned with Iron-Tail in this.


...I'm not going to have to deal with people trying to cut my arm off while I'm sleeping, am I?

I'll do what I can to ensure that doesn't happen.

Should you choose to use it in service of another you can specify strict terms of service to limit abuse.

@Onager#283776 Onager's right. In the future, you'll have to make clear what you will and will not do with your titan.

Can you pass it on to others?
You should try.

Iron-Tail tries to unhatch the armband off of her, which quickly proves impossible. Despite her tugging, pulling, and tinkering it doesn't come off.

... Shit I'm going to have to bathe with this thing on me aren't I?
At least it won't be easily misplaced!

@Iron-Tail#283774 Iron-Tail, I've a tall tale for you...
As a medic, I've witnessed countless moments where life and death hinged on technological advancements.

Take the Thomas splint, for example—a simple long splint with a solid hoop that kept the leg straight. Before its invention, a broken leg carried an 80% mortality rate. 
With the splint, that rate dropped to just 20%.
The same holds true for innovations like the crossbow magazine or a knight's helmet clasp.
...One breakthrough can change the course of everything.
...You have a breakthrough. There. Living in your tricep.

So what's the move?

As much as I appreciate the efforts and recognition that I've gotten here, my home is with the group and the swamp. I'd love to collaborate with the Carmine reach, don't get me wrong, but I'm already a knight to the people who matter. Namely my family, friends, and of course the princess.

See that? That glimmer in her eyes?
She's got the making of a hero, guys. I just know it.

Then it's settled. We do as mercenaries do.
We did the job, now we're off to the next one.

@Iron-Tail#283774 Hey Iron-Tail, your giant... are you going to give it a name? What do you even call something like that?

***Telandor Valarûn.***
*This is a suitable title in modern Elvish for this Bond.*

Name it Killgore 7000! The Eternal Deathdealer.
With a name like that, that's fear in the hearts of your enemies. You can't buy that kind of publicity.

...Giantslayer... That would be a name.

It's Elvish, it's old... Ole Knife-Ear. Oh! Nightfear! Get it? It's wordplay!

Your immaturity is beginning to show, Leonin.
Anna eats another slice of pizza from her fork after hearing this tactless Elven slur.
She is Unbothered.


That depends, what exactly does that name of yours translate to in common, Anna?

*... The Iron Giant.
The Great One.
Protector of Strength.*

*As I've said, words begin to meld as time goes on. Telandor Valarun in Common, is all these titles, yet none.*

*... I suppose 'Telrassë' would be fitting as well.*

Heh.
Telrasse is 'Iron-Tail' in Elvish.

Let's split the difference then. We'll call it Telandor Savior.

It's a fitting name.

Practical. The Elves will know it, and the Common folk will hear 'savior.'


**Iron-Tail has named the mechanical titan 'Telandor Savior'!**


Iron-Tail in the Iron Savior. I like.

---------------------

Yarl's smile suddenly turns to a frown of concern.
Hawke. Business mode.

Hearing this, Hawke's ears perk up.
He moves next to Yarl for a more private conversation.

Yarl motions everyone in the Caerne to follow him.
He guides the group outside of the castle steps, underneath tree shade and away from people.

Everyone, listen up.

At this very moment, we are The Caerne. A mercenary group.
Whoever pays the most, gets our service.
We know this. Everyone knows this.

King Carmine, a ruler aligned with the Red Kingdoms, who is currently fighting a silent war against the Azul Empire, knows this.

And if we decline a contract with him...

He'll think we'll take up a contract with their enemy. *The Empire*.

Yarl touches his nose as a gesture.
Right now, he's seeking council with the other Red Monarchs.

I bet you my 12,000 gold share they'll all say the same thing.

**"Keep them at all costs."**

Wait, so...
Are...
are we going to be fugitives?

Only on paper. They'll word it differently, whatever it takes to get us in their hands.

The King sat us down at his table...
He knows what we look like.
Our faces...

His pigeon carriers are probably not pigeons at all.
Maybe a magic mirror that lets him talk to the other kings instantaneously.

So what do we do?

* We leave.*
***Immediately.***
*No manner of speechcraft will deflect this situation.
Iron-Tail has a weapon that may be reverse-engineered and will undoubtedly turn the war tide.

This turn of events has affected my place amongst the nobles.*

...
Okay. The plan.

It's time we lay low.
Iron-Tail, I say we go to **Boilmarsh**. The swamps is an excellent place for privacy. It's your training arc on how to learn to pilot the Savior.

Who knows, maybe we can learn some things about the Savior and help your people out.

Onager, after the swamps, we'll head to **Dunbridge**. Get some information on our status after some time.
It's a neutral town. No Red or Azul affiliation. Big enough to get lost in.

Kaelrith, Jenna, I know that your plans were to retire, but with the situation at hand, the safest place to be is here with us.

Jenna has a tear in her eye. She nods understandingly.
I understand.

Anna, Kaelrith, we're leaving no trail of The Caerne.
We have to make it look like we were killed or something.

Anna nods.
Illusory Magic.


Not just magic. I want real artifacts. Blur the lines a bit, so that rumors spread.

Hawke, ***Stork Maneuver*** for our things in the chambers.
Now.
He salutes, then cat-sprints off behind the castle stone walls.

Stork Maneuver?

A roped arrow through a window, then burlap sacks with treasure inside to slide down from the arrow's rope.
I had voted to call that trick the 'Stranger in the Night', but...

You're describing rape, you doofus. It's vulgar.
Kaelrith shrugs with one arm unapologetically.

"We're going back to camp.
Grab what you can. Grab some of the horses.
The tents, the spare supplies, everything else..
***We burn.***

Anna, you're gonna hate me for this but...
This includes your wagon.

Anna is visibly angry upon hearing this.


Yarl
"I'll have to talk to Princess Adalithe, make it sound like something's happened with urgency. Put on a show..."

Iron-Tail
"I'm... going to write the princess a letter. I hope she'll understand our complete non-commitment given the circumstances."

Yarl
"Just word it carefully. No mention of where we're going.
If anything, tell her lies. Tell her we're going to some fictional town on the Eastern Shore.

Anything you tell her, King Carmine will learn as well. Best use that to throw them off our trail."

Ugh. We should have brought the crutches.

Derby, help Kayla out. I know I said I would support her until we returned to our chambers, but things have changed.

Kaelrith moves to be supported by Derby.

Derby
"Hmm maybe I can construct something for you, a seat, but with mobility..."
He glances at Iron-Tails savior band.
"Or better yet... some kind of assisted scaffolding... but for people..."

@Derby#283773 Just whip up another golem like Iron-Tail's but for mobility!

Derby brushes his face.
{Another golem...}
{additional golems for the group.... hmm......}

NO.    I was just kidding.  One of those things is plenty for this world.  At least until we fully understand it.

Probably not a bad idea to sort how to repair it though.  ...and clean it, it was pretty rancid.

Well... I don't see anything wrong with remixing what the titan can do, especially to help our friend who's already given us so much. Let's see if we can't make an assisted living frame for Kaelrith. I'm sure there's plenty of tinkerers at Boilmarsh who can help.

Sounds like a plan.

No need to visit Dunbridge on my account.  Word of my presence there would only invite trouble, I'm happy to make amends in the world at large.  I'd consider returning with an army to topple the leadership but then I'd feel responsible if someone worse took over!

Happy to visit Iron-Tail's home though.

Oh, we're not going for an investigators return.

Dunbridge just happens to be a gray area that would suit my own affairs.
The Hags.
If you say that a return would just put us in a bad spot... maybe another town would be best.
... we'll cross that bridge some other time. Should we even need to cross.
Right. We're wasting time. Gather your things, load up Frostfoot and the other horses.

We came in with that driver, and luckily that puts us in a good spot. They'll be looking for his cart.

Nods and heads for the stables to prepare the horses.
Everyone departs in different directions.


Anna and Kaelrith are the first to take action.
They discuss the kind of illusory magic to use, and what evidence to leave as to mislead any guards that investigate.

Luckily, there is a City Watch Investigator amongst them to help their cause and really 'sell the scene'.

They produce 2 *Bags of Holding* which holds 1/2 of the total gold in possession. about 60,000 gold. Anna holds one, and passes the other to Onager.

The rest of the gold is divided by weight onto the group's mounts and a single covered wagon. The wagon holds all the group's tents and foodstuffs. There isn't much space for battle tools or utilities.

Kaelrith rides passenger on the covered wagon.
Surprisingly, the wagon has leaf spring suspension.

Anna haphazardly tosses the bag of holding at Onager's chest.

Anna
*By Yarl's word.*


Derby offers to drive the wagon.

He sighs sadly as he looks at his custom medical tent. It has to go. It needs to be burnt along with the rest of the camp to sell the scene.

He packs the rest of his most used medical supplies and sheathes his cavalry sword.

Jenna makes quick work of gathering her things. It may have been from her time as a carnie.

With Onager's support, she sends firebolts in strategic places all throughout the empty camp, starting from the kitchen area.

Even another investigator would read the scene incorrectly.

Hawke and Yarl return. They are carrying burlap sacks and drenched in their sweat.
They are wearing servant clothes. Yarl has his hair tied in a bun.

Good, **lord**, that was a pain.

It had to be done. Being on horseback that close to the castle would have been too suspicious. We can't take the risk.
Are we all ready?

Everyone nods.

Good.
He hands everyone a cloak. He takes a disguise kit from Hawke.
Believe it or not, they even had your size, Onager.

Anna takes the disguise kit.

She begins to quietly speak to herself.
Slowly, her appearance changes. Her hair becomes an ombre blonde-brunette, then completely brunette.

Her pointed ears become rounded.

Elven features slowly contort until she is no longer beautiful.

She now appears to be a mid 30's human woman with some facial imperfections. freckles, a large mole, etc.

Her clothes appear ragged and ratty; poorly repaired at the elbows and knees.

*I've some scrolls and spells akin to this.*
*Although, not enough for everyone.
Hence, the kit.*

We won't look anything at all like us for the next few hours.

We'll leave Carmine Reach separately through all of their gates. Then reconvene at the abandoned Inn that we stayed at.

King Carmine may already have agents among us.
He looks at Onager.

Orcish... The password is Tusk Love. It was a book I recently read.

He then looks at Derby.
Tusk Love. That's the password.

Then at Iron-Tail.
Tusk Love. The password, that is.

Yarl has Jenna set a few more fires around the camp.

He then tells everyone to depart.

Onager on Frostfoot, by request, stays behind with Yarl.

The group departs, leaving Yarl and Onager amongst a sea of fire.

The last thing that Iron-Tail sees of the camp is Yarl talking to Onager with one hand on their mount reins each.


-----------------------------
...This isn't the first time I've had to fake a raze, my Orcish companion.

After the fake burning, those who were looking for us *still* found us.
...wanna know how?

*...No corpses.*

He begins to walk towards the one horse hitch still untouched by fire.

We live in a world where the dead can be brought back to answer 5 questions.

A world where you or I can read a scroll and talk to squirrels, owlbears.

He ties his mount to the hitch.

That sort of magic is rare. Hopefully Carmine Reach won't have anyone versed in the Old Ways. or the Dark Arts.

Ugh. I don't want to do this.

From a distance, Yarl takes out his longbow.
Nocks an arrow.

*Fwip*

A clean shot. Behind the forelimbs and slightly to the left.
The horse neighs a loud and powerful call before falling on its side with seizing legs.

...*ugh.*

If I wanted to really be thorough, I would have nocked more arrows.

An ugly man with short red hair, clad in black plate armor gets behind the Goliath man, on Frostfoot. Yarl and Onager's disguise.

I did as you said. The letter's on her royal pillow. Quite posh, her Boudoir. It was a pain to bypass the guard at her door, but luckily it wasn't too far from our own chambers.

So... Is that it?
...No more Caerne?


For our individual safety, yes.
The Caerne must disappear for now.


*This is not the first iteration of this group. Nor will it be the last.*

Caerne's just a name. It's not the people.
***... From this moment on, the mercenary group, Caerne, is no more.***

If any of you want to make a new group name for us, I don't mind.

But for now, let's get out of here. The closer we are to Boilmarsh, the better.

The group collectively throw the hood of their cloaks up as some of their illusory disguises start to fade.

The make their way East, to Boilmarsh. Iron-Tail's home.

And with that,
