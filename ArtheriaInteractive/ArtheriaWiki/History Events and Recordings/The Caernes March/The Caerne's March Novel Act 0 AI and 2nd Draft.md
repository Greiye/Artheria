Artheria.  
A world where magic isn’t just a part of life—it’s the heartbeat of it. For centuries, elves have enchanted the realm with their mana-driven marvels, using magic-infused creations to shape everything from grand cities to everyday conveniences. Recently, however, a new force has emerged. Humans, with their steam-powered inventions, are disrupting the status quo in ways no one could have imagined. Suddenly, the world seems to be on the brink of an incredible transformation, and everyone is wondering what lies ahead in this ever-changing adventure.

#### Chapter 1: Joining the Band

For reasons beyond your control, you and a handful of other Initiates have joined this mercenary guild:

**The Caerne.**  
An ancient word from a forgotten era, meaning 'rock.'  
This mercenary group was designed to be a solid entity for others to rely on; the last resort for desperate nobles and warmongers alike.

The Caerne could be the vanguard, reinforcements, or the last line of defense—anything, for anyone, for the right amount of coin.

It has been about two weeks since you've joined. Members of The Caerne are still curious about you.

They watch you. They talk about you while they eat.

Some drop by your tent to ask for your help or tell you to pitch in around camp.

They seem like nice people—mostly nice, when they want to be.

It makes you wonder what kinds of things they've had to do in this line of work and why so many have advised against joining such a group.

## Getting used to the Camp

##### Case 1: Dr. Derby and the Orphan Children

Occasionally, a group of children shows up at the camp. Likely orphans from a nearby orphanage, they are much cleaner than the street urchins you've seen in previous cities. Some of the band members enjoy playing games with them or teaching them how to fight. In return, the kids share local news and tips on where to indulge in vices.

One of the orphans, nicknamed 'Pidgeon,' has a broken arm. The way it bends when he walks makes it look like a bird's wing.

But that's not his only problem. His skin is covered in clear bumps, a telltale sign of **High-Pox**. Highly infectious, this disease can weaken someone for days, if not weeks.

Enter **Dr. Derby Chadwick Merriweather**.  
A man in his early 40s, he has a clean-shaven face and neatly trimmed short hair, accentuated by small, round spectacles perched on his nose, hinting at a sharp intellect beneath. His attire is striking: a long white overcoat conceals a suit of studded leather armor, and his apron and large, weathered gloves are permanently stained with the dark hue of dried blood—an unsettling reminder of his trade. Derby moves with quiet precision, always accompanied by a sturdy leather suitcase and a well-worn backpack filled with medical tools.

Today, he makes a choice.  
"He has the knowledge and medicine to heal Pidgeon and set his arm straight, but doing so will come at the cost of his own health."

Derby watches Pidgeon from a distance, observing the boy for several minutes. His eyes scan over the other children, checking for any signs of High-Pox.

As the children play, Derby keeps his distance, pretending to admire the trees and enjoy the scenery near the village. Yet his gaze repeatedly drifts back to the group.

**None of the other children show signs of High-Pox yet.** But Derby knows it's only a matter of time before the disease spreads to all of them. His medical expertise confirms the grim reality: the infection will inevitably make its rounds.

He recalls the upcoming mission the band leader mentioned. If the children remain in the camp, they could infect the entire group, rendering them unfit for combat. The thought makes Derby's stomach churn.

With a resigned sigh, Derby heads back to his tent. He reaches for his medical suitcase but hesitates, his hand hovering over the handle. After a moment of indecision, he curses softly in Draconic and turns away, a look of determination settling on his face. He strides out to find one of the mercenaries.

Nearby, the band members and children are having a good time, kicking a football around. Derby approaches one of the mercenaries, his voice low but urgent.

“You see that child with the broken arm? He’s carrying a disease—a plague that spreads easily. Warn the others. You need to get them out of here before the whole camp becomes unfit for combat.”

Derby doesn't wait for a response. He turns and heads back toward his tent, deliberately avoiding looking at Pidgeon again. The image of the boy's broken arm, flapping like a chicken wing, is already seared into his mind.

At first, the band members exchange skeptical glances. Who does this medic think he is, giving orders like he’s in charge? He’s not the leader.

But then they recall the times Derby has helped them with mouth sores, foot rashes, and other ailments. His white coat isn’t just for show.

Reluctantly, they take the children's ball and kick it as far away as possible, telling the kids to leave.

Some of the children look puzzled, unsure of what they’ve done wrong. Others roll their eyes, thinking it’s just another group of adults who’ve grown tired of them. They laugh together and start searching for another group to bother.

As Derby returns to his tent, the haunting image of Pidgeon's arm, bending awkwardly like a bird's wing, lingers in his mind.

---------------------------------
##### Case 2: An Old Score and Idle Hands

A few days have passed.

The band has just wrapped up their latest operation. That’s the rhythm here: do a job, go monster hunting, or fight a platoon. Then relax for a week or so while they recruit and account for the losses, keeping their numbers strong.

One of your fellow mercenaries approaches you.

"Darcy, was it? Darby? Or was it Derby, like the races? Doesn’t matter. Listen, I need to talk to you."

He gestures for you to follow him to a wooden bench table in the open kitchen. Derby follows, ignoring the comments about his name, curious about what this might be.

"Listen... the name's Rupert."

"...And I know who you are. You worked on a noble not too long ago, right? Easy money. It was about a year ago, yeah? A nose job? The poor man thought his nose was too big for a noble. And indeed it was. He caught one too many peasants staring at it. Must have looked like a cucumber between his eyes, am I right!? AhaHAHAHA."

"Well... it’s gone sour. Stitches came off a bit too early. The noble got too excited for his birthday present. Now he’s hunting for you, mate. 300 gold pieces for _any_ information on you."

The mercenary pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in.

"You're the Lunatic Doctor. You did it for a noble house that was on its way out. You must have done everything right; you're as brilliant as you are a loon, even the nobles knew that. You just... You didn't account for _**Human Error.**_"

"Now, that’s 300 reasons for me to walk away right now and tell him where you are. Give me a reason why I shouldn’t."

Derby’s thoughts churn for a moment. “Well, the techniques I used were drawn from some ancient manuscripts I discovered in a monk’s temple. Perhaps I shouldn’t have removed all his nose and used his forehead skin to craft it… I suppose there were better choices I could have made.

Ah, and about the bribe you’re demanding—please forgive me. While I might have been able to cover such an amount in my previous profession, that’s no longer the case. Working for passion has its costs. Even if I could pay, how can I be certain you won’t double-cross me and end up with double the value of your bribe?”

"That's simply a risk you'll have to take," the mercenary says, tapping his thumb and fingers on the wooden table in a gesture that clearly signals his demand for money.

Derby takes a moment, his mind racing. "Well, I believe there's more to discuss here. Give me a bit of time to gather your gold. But if you decide to rat me out anyway, remember—are you really willing to get rid of the only doctor keeping these people alive? No doctor means more people getting hurt, increasing your chances of taking a hit, and no one to patch you up if you do. However, if you send them in the wrong direction... well, that's a whole different story, isn’t it?"

The mercenary’s expression shifts. He hadn't considered that angle. You can see the gears turning in his mind.

After a moment, his eyes brighten with a new idea. He looks toward the horizon, watching the sunset.

"... We’ve got about an hour until sundown. 300 gold. No less. If I come back and you don’t have it, I leave, and you’ll _**hang**_ in two days’ time."

With that, he walks away, heading back to his tent. Derby watches him go, then heads to his own tent, casually packing his gear. As he reaches for his bedroll, he reveals an old cavalry rapier and places it beside his belongings. He steps outside, spotting a nearby horse—a fast one.

Behind his tent, he finds a stash of torch and lantern supplies. The lantern fuel, known as kerosene, is stored in several metal jugs, ready for the mercenary band’s night operations. Derby gathers his backpack, sword, and medical suitcase before walking over to the horse.

He cuts the tether and mounts the horse, riding slowly around the camp until he locates the portly mercenary’s tent. The man is already sound asleep.

Derby’s mind races with possibilities. He could douse the tent with lantern fuel and set it ablaze. No one really likes him, anyway. Alternatively, a more direct approach—finding a gun and leading him to a secluded area—flashes through Derby's mind.

Opening his suitcase, Derby retrieves a vial filled with a dark, oily substance and a small firework bomb, a remnant of his experiments with alchemy. He throws the vial at the tent, casting _Grease_, and then ignites it with the firework, using _Fire Bolt_. The moment the flames roar to life, he spurs the horse into a swift gallop away from the scene.

In an instant, the tent is engulfed in flames. No one sees Derby commit arson. No one witnesses the pyromania. The canvas catches fire quickly, turning the man's snores into screams of agony that pierce the night air. The cries last only a few minutes before fading into silence. Mercenaries rush to douse the flames, but it’s already too late. The scent of burning flesh—horrifyingly similar to roasting beef or pork—fills the camp. The other half of the smell is burning leather, thick and acrid. Derby tastes it in his throat, unsure whether he is disgusted by the realization that it’s a human being burning or by the fact that he finds the scent somewhat sweet, like honey barbecue.

Ashes cling to his clothes, a grim reminder of his actions. Throughout the night, the thoughts nag at him—perhaps a bullet would have been kinder. Strangely, he finds himself craving chicken wings.

He rides out of the camp, his alibi set: he was out searching for herbs and medicinal plants, should the band run out of medicine.

The next morning, the camp buzzes with the news of the fat bandmember’s death. Some joke that he must have set fire while cooking beef in his own tent. The group has a dark sense of humor—**vulgar**, even.

When Derby returns, the mercenaries approach him for help, complaining of bleeding gums and sunken eyes. He prescribes oranges for their scurvy. Time passes, and no one mentions the lost comrade. Clearly, the man had as much respect as he did well-fitting armor—next to none, judging by the chatter among the more crass members of the band.

Yet, a nagging feeling lingers in Derby’s mind. Could one or two fellow initiates have seen what happened? Perhaps. Hmmm.

--------------------------------
##### 1st Punch: Onager and an Investigator's Values

You stand by your tent, watching as the Doctor dealt with the street kids. Smart man, that Derby. Quick on his feet. Derby, like the races. Mentally agile. He’s someone you’ll keep an eye on.

It’s your job to know things, after all. Being an investigator means gathering information, and not just any information—accurate information.

And it’s accurate that those kids were sick. Derby did right by sending them away. High-Pox would’ve spread like wildfire through the camp. Nasty stuff, that High-Pox. Here’s looking at you, kid.

It’s also accurate that he set that tent on fire. You saw it happen. Derby didn’t know you saw, but you did.

So did someone else across from you. The figure didn’t know you saw, and Derby didn’t know either of you were watching. The question is, did the other figure see you watching too?

A conundrum.

Two crimes in less than 48 hours.

Scene one of two. Two witnesses, one culprit. What’s the motive? It’s been a day since you saw it, but your mind keeps circling back—

Oi.

You snap back to reality. In front of you stands another half-orc, covered in scars from countless battles, etched into his forearms and shoulders. Around you, other mercenaries gather—humans, half-elves, halflings, even a tiefling or two.

"**LISTEN** when we’re talking to you, greenskin."

"Now, you know we vote on every initiate, yeah? The boss insists. We all get a say in who joins the family. If someone’s not up to snuff, we kick ‘em out."

"...What was I saying? Oh, right. So."

"Yeah, we spared one of the enemy’s cavalry. His hand was smashed up good by a club. Fell off his horse and landed in the mud, leg bent like a twig, barely hanging on."

"He wasn’t a threat. I told the boss we should just slit his throat, give him a merciful end. Otherwise, he’s hobbling around like a fool for the rest of his life. Soldier can’t soldier anymore. Do him a favor and end it."

"But _nooo_, we had to be the good guys. Brought him back here to get patched up."

"And get this, just this morning, the day after that whole tent fire business, on the **morning** we were going to let him go, we find him in Karaku’s tent. Gave Karaku a smile from ear to ear across his throat. On the day we were gonna set him free. Can you believe it? You can’t make this up."

"Now, my issue is:"

"...How’d he manage that?"

"Guy’s got a busted wing and a broken leg, yet he somehow got out of his bindings, found a knife—dull one at that—crawled through the mud **again**, and did in Karaku."

"That’s a good ten meters he crawled—30 feet, for you simpletons—to get to Karaku’s tent. Did he even know where he was going? Who knows."

"And nobody saw him? Not a soul? Too busy keeping each other warm all night, were we? I say there’s something foul afoot. FOUL play."

The half-orc’s gaze settles on you, Onager.

"...Your tent was next to Karaku’s, yeah? Mine was on the other side."

"It’s fine that you didn’t hear nothing. I didn’t either, and I was sober last night. My eyes and ears are sharp, same as my blade. Not that one—this one:"

He pulls out a small knife from a cord around his neck and slams it onto the wooden table.

"My issue is this:"

**"...Could’ve been you.**"

"Or me. Could’ve been both of us waking up with a blade to our throats. Karaku just drew the short straw."

A pause.

"...So."

He stands, puts one foot on his seat, rests an arm on his knee, and leans in, waiting for your response.

"Next time we find a poor sod after a battle, why _**shouldn’t**_ we make it quick? The boss says it’s bad for business—that the nobles won’t hire us if we start putting holes in the wounded whenever we feel like it. But I say it’s not such a big deal. I say it’s not that deep."

"I say we should all _ahem_ ‘vote to change the terms of engagement during a battle,’ as the boss would put it."

The whole band is gathered, around ten or fifteen of you, though the Captain is absent.

The half-orc is setting you up, putting you on the spot where everyone will remember what you say, adding a touch of drama to the proceedings.

What do you do?

---

You clear your throat and speak.

"The Captain’s orders were clear, and I’ll follow them. If there’s ever a time they’re not, or I take issue with them, I’ll bring it up with him directly. As for what happened with the prisoner, I’m more than willing to investigate how he managed it, track him down, and either finish what his fall started or drag him back here to face justice."

The half-orc scrutinizes your face for sincerity, then shifts his gaze to a glint in the distance that catches everyone’s attention.

You all turn to see the head of the camp approaching, a smile on his face, carrying a sack of supplies slung over his shoulder.

"Case by case, eh? Okay, okay. I see you, greenskin."

"Ladies and gents, we’ve got someone here who knows how to throw their weight around. I figured as much, judging by that old 'Udo getup he’s got on."

He retrieves his knife from the table, using it to lazily gesture at your uniform.

"Well, I’m off to my duties."

With that, the rest of the group begins to disperse from the open chow hall. You’re left wondering if their view of you has shifted, uncertain whether their opinions have changed or remained the same.

------------------------
##### Cog # 1: Iron Tail and a coin purse

As Iron-Tail is doing her duties around camp, she overhears the boss, Yarl, talking to a fellow bandmember. They're talking about the recent crimes in camp.

Two of my men. **dead** . On the same day. Too close a coincidence.

Rupert was as trustworthy as he is fast, but he didn't deserve his fate. Burned to a crisp because he wanted a bit more to eat. Maybe if he was more open to sharing he would've cooked in the open kitchen, and he wouldn't be 6 feet under by that tree.

And Karaku... 
He was a good man. His wife will miss him.

Ex-Wife.

He was indispensable. He had a way with the ladies in all the taverns and festivals we visited.

Probably why his wife left him.

Wait, what? But Karaku kept talking about her as if his wife was a goddess. In great detail, at that. Golden hair, unworldly grace. He spoke of her so much, I found myself praying at her feet. In a sense, of course.

Prayed with her image in mind as well. Prayed almost every night. My praying hand aches just thinking about her.

He will be missed.

Oh, and I got the thing that you wanted. Earth Shaper Scrolls.

He passes the other mercenary a stack of scrolls. They're all wrapped up individually in leather.

Now I have to handle our gimp cavalier. An example is to be made.

Jarl gets up quickly and heads off. So too, does the other campmember.

Iron-Tail sees a glimmer. Where the two were just sitting is left a coinpurse.
It's spilled open, revealing gold coins, gems, sticks of herbs, and a few handmade trickets.

Upon closer inspection: *A human finger, preserved in a yellow substance in a small bottle sits in the coinpurse.*

What do you do?

Iron-Tail stops with what she was doing earlier, looking at the pile of treasures with some curiosity. The gold and gems made sense, and the herbs and sticks she could wave away as some sort of casting focus. But the finger was just macabre and distasteful. Fortunately, her reputation as a swamp country bumpkin gave her just enough clout to act in a certain matter. She grabs the pouch, but makes sure to dangle the finger in front of her as she tries to reunite the finger with their owner

Sir! Sir! You forgot your finger!

You follow after the other mercenary. It's not a sir.

It's an Owlin woman. 
You've seen her around camp, but haven't had a chance to say anything to her until now. 

She turns to see you, a warm expression on her face. Maybe due to not being a lot of women in the camp?

When she sees the finger dangling in front of you, her expression sours.

OH, uhh... ...th-that's...

She takes it quickly. 

Thanks.
She leaves in a rush. She doesn't bother to ask about the rest of the coinpurse.

Glad I could help out.
Iron-Tail turns around as the Merc scuttles off with her weird trinket. She's from the swamp, and is no stranger to macabre trinkets, even if they are a bit distasteful. Glowing with pride, she honestly forgets that she's holding into the pouch, and will probably keep forgetting until late at night when she checks over all of her things.

You're a bit confused of what just transpired with the other merc.

As the days pass, you learn that her name is Kaelrith, or Kayla for short. She's one of the older members of the group and is close with the leader, Yarl. They have a unique bond, as Kayla speaks to Yarl like a childhood friend.

When you ask about the finger, all you get is confusion.
No one knows anything about it, and thinks it as something Kaelrith wouldn't dare touch.

Since then, there are nights where you feels eyes on you. You can see in the dark as a proud Nezumi can, so if there's anything watching you from afar, you're confident you can see it.

You wonder about the strength of an owl's night vision.


---------------------------
##### Case 3: On the other side


Derby has become quite integrated with the group. Whenever someone falls ill or injures themselves, they're quick to visit 'The Doc'. You've seen your fair share of infections and sprains.

They've even set up a clinic tent in your honor, right next to your own, adorned with your symbol.

The Caerne has journeyed through numerous cities and towns since the fire.

While out shopping and socializing in one city with Iron-Tail to your left and Onager to your right, you spot a young man in pristine, noble clothing staring intently at you.

He approaches, visibly excited.

“It’s... it’s you. Gods above.”

He hesitates, then continues, “Do-do you remember me? Maybe you don’t. That’s fine, you had so many patients. Look, maybe—”

He starts to unbutton his sleeve. At first, you see nothing but a normal arm, leaving your companions puzzled.

“I know, everyone has the same look when I tell this story. Look—”

As he tugs the skin of his arm slightly, a hair-thin scar, marked by tiny dermal staple scars, becomes visible, running from his pinky all the way up his arm to his shoulder blade.

“It runs all the way to my shoulder blade. The old Doc’s a genius. This is *his* handiwork.”

You remember him now. A good lad who, tired of field rations, prepared you a rabbit stew with local herbs and provided cover during arbalist attacks.

“I’m actually in a bit of a rush—I’m about to be knighted. Valor in the field and all that. It took a while for the arm to heal, but when it did, it healed perfectly. And it’s thanks to you.”

He continues, “Is there anything I can do for you? I’ve got coin now. Need a favor of any kind?”

The half-orc investigator and the Nezumi step aside, observing how you handle this offer.

Derby responds, “I’m always delighted to hear that a patient of mine is thriving after such an operation.”

He adds, “As for a favor... well, money is always needed, but anything of value to you would be enough.”

The young man’s expression softens slightly, as if slightly disappointed by your response.

He reaches into his pocket and produces a golden pocket watch, intricately designed with the image of a four-eyed lion. He places it in your hand.

“I am **Etan Pendragon**. This is my symbol—a four-eyed lion that represents the Pendragon Line. I will inform my family of what happened today. Those in any of the Red Kingdoms will recognize this and treat you with the utmost respect, or face dire consequences. You’ve earned this boon.”

He looks into your eyes with a burning intensity, his respect evident.

“It’s only right that I give this to you. In a way, you’ve given me more time than anyone else.”

Etan pulls away, saluting Onager with a fist to his chest and bowing deeply to Iron-Tail. With precise military training, he rotates 180 degrees and marches off, accompanied by six plainclothes individuals—his hidden guard.

**Derby has obtained a Golden Pocketwatch!**

The interaction felt a bit rushed and surprising. It’s only when you return to camp that you realize something. 

You fought for the *Azul Empire*, not the Red Kingdoms.

Derby examines the pocket watch with a fascinated gaze. What an intriguing young man—perhaps a prince or a duke? Surely, an important person.

------------------------------
##### 2nd Punch: Veteran's Revolt

Your experience with mercenary groups has taught you much about their nature. Mercenaries are sellswords, soldiers for hire. As cities grow, they need more than their own guard can provide, leading to neighboring cities supplying these hired hands. It's a cycle of war and profit; where there's conflict, there's money. Mercenaries spend their earnings on revelry, embodying the chaotic nature of their trade.

Yet, Yarl's group stands out. Unlike many, Yarl prioritizes honorable contracts, taking on lower-paying jobs for scholars and enduring injuries for modest pay. There's something commendable about him.

**"I say we take him after he's done with one of his charity jobs."**

You wake in the night, the grayness of dawn illuminating your tent. Peering out, you spot the half-orc from before—the one with the dramatic scars. You listen in.

They’re plotting to turn Yarl in for a bounty when he's at his most vulnerable. The life of a mercenary means you'll be either revered or despised wherever you go. In the coming days, as the group travels, there’ll be a few places where Yarl has a price on his head.

You recall his recent missions—tedious work, like that contract for digging through old relics for a measly 30 gold, despite having passed up a 200 gold contract. The half-orc is rallying support to overthrow Yarl and focus on profits instead of these so-called charity jobs.

The camp is divided, with half the members listening to him. His plan involves turning this "dictatorship" into a "democracy," shifting focus to money and indulgence.

At midday, with three hours until sunset, you face a choice. Using your connections, you could have the local guards arrest those conspiring with the half-orc, perhaps even frame them with planted evidence. This route will likely lead to a full-blown fight, consuming the next three hours.

Alternatively, you remember why you joined the group. Not for the money, but there’s something about Yarl. Despite his less lucrative contracts, he knows how to secure the best jobs, and his charisma commands respect. Aligning with him could be beneficial.

**Cast out Yarl** or **Report half the camp?**

Onager emerges from his tent as the half-orc's rants continue. He addresses the gathered crowd with a steely gaze.

"Are we plotting a mutiny now? Have we so little loyalty that we would ambush a man we’ve all sworn to support? No one here is chained to the March. If you’re unhappy with the leadership, leave with your honor intact. Don’t tarnish your reputations and ruin your careers. Better jobs are out there, but who will hire a mercenary company that can’t even trust its own?"

His eyes lock on the scarred half-orc, knowing his stance might invite danger. Then he surveys the crowd, making it clear that he’s ready for a confrontation.

"Which of you will be the first to attack Yarl? And how many times has he saved you? How many of you will fall before you manage to take him down?"

Standing tall at 6'8", Onager crosses his massive arms and scans the crowd for signs of dissent, preparing for the worst.

The scarred half-orc stands on a wooden table, still eyeing Onager.

With a grim smile, Onager unfolds his arms and gives a decisive nod.

**"HE KNOWS TOO MUCH, LADS. GET 'IM."**

They charge at you with weapons drawn. In the chaos, swords slice through the air as you nimbly dodge and counter with precision strikes that could be lethal if you chose. Arrows and bolts whiz by, some of them dangerously close. You deftly roll and duck, evading the onslaught with an almost supernatural agility.

Despite your imposing size, you manage to tuck and roll with remarkable speed, quickly regaining your feet. Your impressive maneuvers draw curious glances from those around you.

The commotion stirs the camp, rousing those who had been sleeping. They join the brawl, adding to the chaos.

After about 30 minutes of intense fighting, the conspirators are either restrained, knocked out, or have fled. Out of the original 14 members of The Caerne, only 7 remain, battered but united.

The half-orc who instigated the mutiny is bound and has a broken arm, courtesy of Onager. He had attempted to use a knife, but Onager acted swiftly to prevent serious injury.

Onager turns to you with a grim expression. 

"I'd hang you myself now if I didn’t want to see you squirm as you explain yourself to Yarl."

"No need to wait."
Yarl approaches.
Onager steps aside, giving Yarl a respectful nod.

Yarl
"I've known about this traitor's plans for some time. It was the elephant in the room. I just thought it was only talk and nothing more, to make himself look bigger. A bit taller." Onager says, bowing slightly to Iron-Tail. "It's easy to spot a threat when they're brandishing their swords on their hip. This one thought; This one's a sharp tongue—his true weapon.

Onager
—but lacks the wit to match."

Yarl throws a coil of rope to Onager. He begins preparing a noose, searching for a suitable tree.

"So, Investigator, what should we do with him? I can’t just let him go. He needs to be made an example of, something everyone will remember." Yarl watches you as Onager efficiently handles the noose. 

Onager
"We can hang him, or I can cut him loose and beat him to death. He called for both our executions; he deserves no less."


Yarl glances around, taking note of Kayla, Derby, and you, as if weighing options. 

Yarl
"...Make it quick. Painless. I’m not a monster."

After swiftly tending to wounds, the camp sets up a hanging podium with crates and barrels. Out of the seven uprisers, only three remain: the half-orc and two others. Those who wish to witness the execution can, though most choose not to.

The noose is prepared with a tall tree as the backdrop. The crates are stacked high enough so that the half-orc only needs to step off to end his life.  As the noose tightens around his neck, the scarred half-orc chuckles nervously. 

Torgon
"Heheheh... I guess I got a real answer from you after all, eh? About a quick death?"

He smirks. "Can’t fault you. I would’ve come back with an even bigger group."

"What’s your name, greenskin? You owe me the honor of that much."

In Orcish
"Not your common name either; Your full Orcish name. Your real name."

Onager steps up behind him, grabbing his shoulder and a handful of hair.

Onager
"Onager Caerne."

With a swift, violent motion, he snaps the half-orc’s neck. The body dangles from the tree, the neck extending as his toes barely graze the grass.

The two remaining conspirators fall to their knees, praying desperately to any god's name that they'd hear in passing. They recognize the futility of their situation.

Yarl looks on with a face of distaste. He approaches the last two survivors, and drags them to the edge of camp where he cuts their bonds.

"I watched Torgon as I did Big Rupert for some time now. I remember your faces. Torgon was the mastermind and you two were simply talked into corroboration. Probably thought 'strength in numbers,' right? Easy money?"

"If I see either of you again - Passing on the street, by chance at a tavern; **I break you**. Then and there." 

"Best you become sailors if you want some guarantee of safety."

The two flee, one leaving a trail of urine in his wake.

Yarl senses Onager's presence behind him. 


Yarl
"...It was the right decision, friend. Whatever god they prayed to found mercy in me today."

"Some days I think I’m too merciful. I try to be forgiving, but 'A snake, cornered and kept, will strike when least expected.'

It’s never easy.
But nothing worth having comes easy, right?"


Onager
"Nothing at all."
"...I’m sorry we couldn’t reach more of them. I knew what would happen with the half-orc, but I hoped to sway a few others."

Yarl looks back in the distance, at the hanging body from the tree.

"We’re mercenaries. 
For every good recruit, there’s eleven bad ones. These lot need only a silver piece and a tankard to be swayed."

"You did well Onager, —better than good."


**Onager has earned Yarl, The Caerne Leader's Trust!**
Onager gives a rueful smile.


Yarl motions towards the remaining camp members with a tilt of his neck.
"Come Let’s check on everyone. We need to figure out how best to move forward. Half the camp in just these few weeks... Time to assess and plan our next move."

Onager nods in agreement.

Yarl
"Also, How did I do that? That thing where you roll?"

Onager shrugs.
"Good blood, I guess."

The body remains hanging until sunset.
Yarl and Kaelrith are seen eventually take it to the forest.


-----------------------------

##### Cog # 2: We choose our friends

A few days have passed since Torgon's Uprising. Everyone's had to pull double shifts to compensate for the loss of manpower.

Yarl, visibly tired from managing the camp and conducting interviews, approaches Iron-Tail with a form on a clipboard and a quill of ink.

**Yarl:** "Iron-Tail, I'm glad I caught you. You, Derby, and Onager have been pulling your weight and then some. It's been a blessing."

He hands you the clipboard.

**Yarl:** "As I created this band, I wanted everyone to contribute to recruitment. Here’s a list of potential recruits."

The form lists:

1. Ravenna "Shade" Valek
2. Brom "Hammer" Stonefist
3. Mira "Silver Tongue" Voss
4. Kael "Whisper" Thorn
5. Lyra "Spark" Emberwind – Demolition Expert and Pyromancer

Yarl continues:

"Torgon was a natural businessman. We need someone like him again, or perhaps a sniper or a mechanical expert. If you want my judgment, Jenna, Oren, and Kael seem like decent candidates. Jenna has potential for both combat and additional skills."

**Iron-Tail:** "Gilda the Arcane Metalworker also seems promising for honing our weapons."

He sighs, clearly exhausted.

**Iron-Tail:** "If you want my help, I could handle gathering and interviewing candidates. You have the final say, but we're a team, and you can rely on us."

Yarl, looking more tired by the minute, appreciates the offer.

**Yarl:** "I’ll depend on you a bit. Let me get some rest and think about it."

"You do that, boss."

The next day, Yarl has you and Onager taking the big caravan wagon to gather supplies for the camp—food, materials, kerosene, and more. He asks you to renegotiate the deals to get better prices.

The dynamic between you and Onager was a bit like a good cop/bad cop routine. The wagon leaned heavily toward Onager’s side as it approached the merchant’s business.

Onager, feeling under the weather and clearly irritable, had a menacing demeanor all day. At 6'8", this easily irritable half-orc had a reputation that preceded him.

It was either deal with him or with you. _They chose you._

Your 'swampy charm' worked wonders with the merchants, and you managed to secure several discounts. With both of you being strong, you didn’t need extra hands, so the wagon had more room for storage.

By the time you returned from a day of haggling and hauling, Yarl looked more rested.

“Ah, Iron-Tail, look who joined us while you were gone.”

You see a young woman with pale skin, bright red hair, and foreign clothes. She seems a bit out of place.

“Jenna, this is Iron-Tail. She’s the one who recommended you.”

“She's from the swamps, has some engineering experience, and enjoys tinkering with tech.”

“H-Hi.”

Iron-Tail extends her arms, expecting a hug.

“Welcome to the band, Jenna! As Yarl said, I’m Iron-Tail. I vouched for you, though Yarl also endorsed you. It’s great to finally meet you.”

Jenna hesitates but then steps into the hug, holding on tightly as though she hasn’t embraced anyone in a long time.

You feel a slight sizzling sensation. When she pulls away, you notice a faint smoke and the smell of scorch around you. Your clothes are singed and marked by her touch.

“Ah, she’s Emberborn—Fire Genasi, to be precise. She runs hot but not hot enough to start fires while she sleeps. If you give her a glass of water, though, it’ll boil in an hour.”

“I keep a fireproof bolt of fabric from back home. I’m a _great_ seamstress.”

“I should have guessed from the emphasis on fire. No harm done, right? Besides, it looks like you could use a hug anyway.”

_‘A Warm Personality,’_ as her billboards would say.

Jenna looks at you and smiles.

“We’ll be great friends, I’m sure of it.”

“I get that vibe too. Now, how about we celebrate your arrival with a little party? We’ll use some of the savings from our deals for a night on the town!”

“Sounds good to me. My time at the carnival didn’t leave me much time for anything else.”

“A night out, huh? Let’s see where this takes us. I’ll go get Kaelrith.”

The news of the outing spreads quickly through the camp. The city they’re in has a perfect setup for a fun night out, with numerous taverns close together for a proper crawl. Jenna, having recently left the carnival, can get you through without charge, and a popular bard known for drawing a raucous crowd of nobles and peasants will be performing at a local tavern.

Tonight promises to be a memorable one.


--------------------------

## Night on the Town

The camp is a flurry of activity as everyone scrambles to get ready before sunset. As the sun dips to a dull orange-blue, the group is finally set for their night out:

--------------
**The Caerne Shenanigans Group Appearance:**

**Yarl**  
An athletic human man with long, wavy hair and a light olive skin tone. He wears a simple white tunic, a blown belt, black pants, and brown boots.

**Kaelrith**  
An Owlin woman with white-black tipped feathers. She sports a simple black dress that reaches the floor and carries a small red purse.

**Jenna**  
An Emberkin (Fire Genasi) woman with bright orange hair and white-ashen skin. She’s dressed in a big jacket, black baggy pants, and intricately designed red/black shoes.

**Derby**  
A clean-shaven human medic in his 40s. He’s dressed formally and blends in seamlessly with the locals.

**Onager**  
A 6'8" muscular half-orc in casual attire, wearing a city watch uniform that’s informal enough not to be recognized as such unless you’re part of the city watch.

**Iron-Tail**  
A muscular black-furred Ratkin who dresses however she pleases.

-------------------

**Yarl:**  
“I’ve been so focused on work. I don’t even remember the last time I just relaxed. I’m so tense.”

**Kaelrith:**  
“There was that one time you met that halfling girl.”

**Yarl:**  
“Oh yeah. I hope she’s okay. She was a nice girl.”

**Kaelrith:**  
“Last I heard, she caught High-Pox. No one would hire her because of all the scabs. Or was it *you* that gave it to her…?”

**Yarl:**  
“Shut up, shut UP, Kaelrith!”

Yarl begins to ruffle Kaelrith’s feathers. She responds by flapping her wings to blow wind and dust at him.

**Yarl:**  
“AHH!”

He storms off to his tent to fix his hair.

Jenna, sitting on top of a barrel with her big jacket beneath her, playfully dangles her legs.

Kaelrith notices Jenna and inches closer.

**Kaelrith:**  
“…”

**Jenna:**  
“…”

**Kaelrith:**  
“He—”

**Jenna:**  
“Um… Ah, *ahem.* I’m… Jenna. I’m new. Iron-Tail hired me on.”

**Kaelrith:**  
“She didn’t hire you. Yarl did. He’s the leader of The Caerne. He’s the one who hired you, not Iron-Tail.”

**Jenna:**  
“…”

An *awkward* pause follows.

**Kaelrith:**  
“I’m…”

**Kaelrith:**  
“Kaelrith. That’s *my* name. No—my name is... I’m—”

She storms off, and with a powerful beat of her white Owlin wings, takes off into the dim purple sky.

Jenna watches, puzzled.

**Jenna:**  
“…Was it something I said?”

------------

The group is ready for their outing.

**Yarl:**  
“I heard there’s a place here that specializes in different ales—Hoppy, Amber, Dark. I want to try that.”

**Kaelrith:**  
“I saw a poster for a bookstore that’s closing soon. I want to find something interesting to read.”

**Jenna:**  
“The sights! I want to go sightseeing. Work always had me so tired, I never had the energy to explore.”

**Iron-Tail: Thinks to herself:**  
“I want to have a good time, get blackout drunk, and bond with Jenna and Yarl.”

It seems each member of the group has something in mind for their night out.


------------------------------
#### **The Bookstore**

The first stop is Kaelrith’s choice. Although the plan initially focused on the Ale Flight place, Kaelrith’s insistence about the bookstore’s imminent closing persuaded Yarl to prioritize it.

As it turns out, Kaelrith was right. If they had arrived just 15 minutes later, the bookstore would have been closed.

Kaelrith quickly navigates the tiny store, brushing dust off the books she finds interesting. Her eyes dart across titles, and her hands skim through pages.

After 10 minutes of browsing and five intense minutes of consideration, she picks up a book on the local area's ecosystem. Beaming with happiness, she clutches her purchase proudly.

-----------------

#### The Alehouse


The two-story tavern is alive with activity, bustling with patrons of all kinds. Yarl heads straight to the bar and orders drinks for everyone.

To his disappointment, the tavern doesn’t live up to its promise of “15 different ales.” The ‘light ale’ turns out to be a simple watered-down brew, and their so-called ‘Hoppy Variety’ is served with a few slams on the counter, dubbed the “rabbit special.”

“It’s all you can drink! What more do you want, eh!? Doesn’t taste like honey, but it doesn’t taste like piss either! If you don’t like it, leave! Get drunk and get out!”

Despite this, the group enjoys their drinks.

Iron-Tail rolls a 12.

Iron-Tail encourages Yarl to drink more, clearly enjoying the spectacle. Yarl, a fan of "the art in everything," takes his drinking seriously.

**Yarl:**  
“It’s not enough to just get shit-faced. One must be shit-faced… _with decorum_.”

He downs a flagon of ale in one go, pinky extended. After five flagons, Yarl’s demeanor shifts from charismatic leader to schoolboy testing his limits. He starts pushing Onager, Dr. Derby, and Iron-Tail to match his drinking pace.

Iron-Tail finds this amusing and mentions it to Yarl.

**Iron-Tail:**  
“I used to attend an institution of _hic_ high regard. I was to lead a life of extravagance and class among nobles and books… I found it to be tedious. Boorish, really.”

Yarl playfully bumps Iron-Tail’s shoulder.

**Yarl:**  
“All that stringy muscle you’ve got on you. Do you—_hic_—do you know how best to implement it? What it’s all good for?”

He slams a full flagon of ale in front of you, spilling a few drops onto your clothes. He bows and leaves you to mingle with his newly formed party.

His charisma proves infectious. Yarl starts involving everyone in games—skinny farmers who reek of manure and beautiful young noblewomen who seem out of place. He deals cards among the farmers and wagers small bets of copper, getting everyone to open up and chat.

He regales the crowd with tales of The Caerne, including the close call with the betrayer, _the War Veteran Torgon_. The noblewomen are impressed, and one sits next to Yarl, tracing her finger on his chest as he continues his stories, paying her little mind.

Yarl, however, seems to lose track of his limits.

**Kaelrith** notices Yarl’s increasing rowdiness and subtly tries to temper his drinking, occasionally covering his flagon when he reaches for it.

At Kaelrith’s request, Yarl calms down a bit. She pats him on the head and returns to her corner table.

Iron-Tail talks with Jenna, discovering more about her background.

**Jenna:**  
“My people are so sparse in these lands.”

She finishes her third flagon of ale and puts it upside down on the table.

“The last time I met a fellow Emberkin was when I was 9 years old, at my Uncle’s family. That was 12 years ago.”

She demonstrates some of her fire abilities, showing off her jacket and gloves, which are triple-layered for a reason. She sits directly on the wooden bench, leaving a scorch mark from the heat. She then scoots back onto her jacket to hide the mark.

Looking to Iron-Tail for a reaction, Jenna realizes the bench now bears a permanent scorch mark of her backside. She quickly covers it with her jacket and sits back down.

The party is buzzing and having a great time. Yarl decides to move on to the next event of the night.

Jenna is the last to leave. With a deep breath, she drinks the last of her fourth flagon of ale, grabs her jacket, and makes a hasty exit before anyone notices the scorch mark.

------------------------
#### Sightseeing

The group heads towards the Carnival, Jenna’s former workplace. As they make their way, they notice how vibrant the city has become at night. Teenagers and adults alike roam from tavern to tavern, street musicians play, and food stands and portable market stalls line the streets.

In the center of the city stands a giant fountain that captures Jenna’s attention. It features a ten-foot statue of a Tiefling man riding a horse, with water shooting from the horse’s mouth into the fountain. The plaque reads: *“Kavik, the Savior of the Land.”*

Nearby, a mustached man with a strange wooden box catches Jenna’s eye.

**Jenna:**  
“Oh, I know what that is! I’ve seen him in another town!”

Jenna grabs Iron-Tail’s hand and leads her to the man. They return and beckon the group to the front of the fountain. The man gets behind the wooden box and covers himself with a blanket.

**Man:**  
“Alright now, stay proper.”

The group is puzzled but remains still. Jenna and Iron-Tail are the only ones keeping a smile.

A **flash of light** erupts, leaving everyone dazed. It’s as if the sun had reappeared briefly. More intermittent flashes follow.

**Man:**  
“Just a moment, I have to change the film… Alright now, an improper expression. Posture!”

**Jenna:**  
“Make a silly face! Do a silly move! Hurry!”

Everyone strikes a pose, and several more flashes occur. The photos come out darker than expected.

Jenna and Iron-Tail chat with the man and exchange something with him before rejoining the group.

**Jenna:**  
“Look!”

Jenna holds several pieces of parchment. Removing a glove, she snaps her fingers, creating a small light to illuminate them.

The parchments reveal drawings of the group in front of the fountain.

**Yarl:**  
“Ah, a magical sketch of some kind? I’m sure Kaelrith could have done this herself—ow, Kaelrith, don’t poke me there. I’m still sore from Torgon…”

**Kaelrith:**  
“No, it doesn’t *feel* magical. How peculiar.”

**Jenna:**  
“He said it’s a thing of powder, reverse light… I don’t know, I didn’t go to school.”

**Yarl:**  
“A keepsake for the group! Good thinking. It’s only been half a day, but you’re really showing your smarts, Jenna. I knew you were a fine addition to the team.”

Jenna blushes, and the spaces between her long hairs flicker with a tiny flame.

Each group member takes a photo for themselves.

**Everyone receives a Keepsake Photo!**

The group finds Onager’s expression particularly hilarious. He’s making a kissy face, perfectly aligned with the hero’s statue behind him.

The group continues to explore, encountering women in various fashions and other mercenaries like themselves. They occasionally duck into taverns to keep their buzz going.

**Derby** explains to a group of wizards that inebriation isn’t caused by tiny snakes but by ale being a mild sedative that affects the brain through the liver and stomach, much like food or water.

**Wizard:**  
“Wha—NO. We learned this in the academy. The snakes bite you in the stomach over and over again, and the venom poisons your thoughts. Any bigger and the snake venom kills you. You have to eat bread; the snakes eat the bread. They become happy and don’t bite anymore. Then you just piss them out.”



Before long, the band finds themselves at the entrance of a bustling medieval carnival on the edge of town.

--------------------
### The Carnival

A massive steam generator hisses occasionally from a high port, resembling the thick mast of a ship. Lanterns connected to it cast a warm, golden glow over the carnival. Stalls line the streets, reminiscent of the city's merchant districts. The air is filled with laughter, music, and the enticing aroma of roasted meats.

Children chase after tiny, mechanical steam-powered soldiers and horses—_high-pox free_, of course.

------------------------
##### Admission

A long line stretches to the entrance.

“Don’t worry about the line. Follow me.”

Jenna takes the lead, expertly weaving through the crowd.

“Jenna? Back so soon? How did it go with that travel band you were talking about?”

“Oh, this is them! This is the Caerne!”

“Oh, right. Um… okay.”

There’s a brief, awkward silence as they both seem uncertain of what to say next.

“Anyway, Darren said I could drop by anytime, thanks to all my hard work here.”

“Yeah, sure. Of course.”

The attendant gives a casual wave, and Jenna leads the party through the entrance.

-------------------------
##### **Past Admission**

The renowned bardic musicians Yarl heard about are performing on a high stage, delivering a powerful, heavy rhythm. The crowd dances energetically in an open grassy field, with the music magically amplified so intensely that the bass drum feels like it's thumping directly into your chest.

A few carnival-goers sit on the periphery, their expressions vacant. In front of them, half-naked harlequins with glowing fingertips captivate onlookers, their fingers moving in mesmerizing, impossible patterns.

“Oh gods, they’re here. I thought they were on the other side of town.”

It’s **Tiestoux**.

Kaelrith gives Yarl a hearty slap on the back and pushes past Jenna. She turns, acknowledges everyone with a bow, and then melts into the crowd.

“Yeah, we’re not going to worry about her. She’ll be fine.”

The party continues on.

Everyone indulges in giant turkey legs, plays carnival games, and engages in playful banter with the children.

As Onager and Derby prepare for their next moves, they sense the **cosmos** aligning, hinting that fortune—or misfortune—is about to unfold. It feels like everything will be alright.

Initially intimidated by Onager’s massive size, the children part like a hot knife through butter. However, a half-orc woman encourages her two young ones, who are still small enough to blend in with other children except for their green skin, to approach Onager. Soon, other children follow suit, seeing him as a living playground. Onager swings them around and lets them sit on his shoulders, delighting them.

Meanwhile, Derby engages in small talk with the jesters and harlequins passing by. They are intrigued by the well-dressed man with spectacles. At one point, the group looks back to see Dr. Derby breathing fire with a torch. The jesters clap and whisper in approval, clearly impressed.

--------------------------
##### Cog #3: Iron Tail and the Engine

Yarl playfully bumps into Iron-Tail and Jenna.

“Ladies, we’ve got a problem.”

“I think…”

“…I think _I’m sobering up_.”

Jenna gasps theatrically.

“Oh, _whatever shall we dOooOo_”

“Our Orcish friend and Medic Extraordinaire are indisposed. Soon, we will all be sober, and the night will lose its sparkle.”

Jenna turns with exaggerated drama, placing a hand to her temple.

“Oh, mercy! We must remedy this immediately! Irontail, come with me. I know a man who runs a bar, with the right vapors and spirits for our plight!”

She grabs Iron-Tail and leads him away.

As Jenna fetches more ale, Iron-Tail examines the massive steam generator powering the festival lights. The machine is loud, chugging away with a large puddle of water spreading about five feet around it.

On closer inspection, he notices the filter is dirty and moldy. The water generators back home in the swamps were always meticulously cleaned.

The engineer, a burly man in a yellow construction helmet, stands nearby.

Iron-Tail explains, “The dirty water filter needs replacing. The buildup inside the generator forces it to work harder, causing faster wear and tear. The pipes might get clogged, and the machine could even crack or burst. It’s essential to use clean water to keep the machine running smoothly and prevent breakdowns.”

Iron-Tail grabs a wrench from a toolbox on a nearby crate and immediately swings it toward the side of your head. You pull back just in time as the wrench clangs loudly against the steam generator pipes.

“…You beastfolk are something else. Truly, truly something else.”

“I will _not_ be talked down to by an _**overgrown PEST**_.”

“Just because your kind can _slur_ the Common language doesn’t mean diddly squat to me.”

“Disgusting swamp rat. I can smell the sewer on you and yours.”

He turns to Jenna.

“_**…We got a problem, torchlight?**_”

She takes a few cautious steps back, clearly unsure of how to handle the situation.

“Yeah.”

“That’s what I thought.”

He turns back to his console, dismissing both of you.

Under his breath
Ain’t _no one_ gonna tell me how to keep the carnival lights on. That generator’s been fine for years; it'll be fine for another ten. I’ve stomped rats bigger than you dead. Think I’ll treat you any differently because you squeak my language? Try again.

Iron-Tail considers the situation.

**Iron-Tail's Thoughts:**  
"It would be so easy to walk away and let this be just an unpleasant end to an otherwise great evening. After all, it’s not like she works for the carnival, and if it suffers because of an incompetent, racist technician, it’s no skin off her back. But her pride and inebriation compel her to intervene. She’s determined to humble this bigot. Iron-Tail pretends to walk away from the technician. As soon as she’s out of view, she swivels around and casts *Command*, uttering a single word: *‘Piss.’*”

The technician, busy flicking switches and turning knobs unnecessarily, suddenly feels a warm sensation in his groin, trailing down his legs. He looks down in horror to find he has urinated on himself.

A halfling approaches the technician, eyeing the large stain on his pants. Iron-Tail reads the back of his construction vest: **Superintendent**.

“Henry, I need you to take a look at the maintenance logs. You’ve been writing that you do rust checks every four hours on the dot, but I noticed some rust just the other day. Show me how you conduct your checks—”

He stops abruptly, staring at the urine stain directly at eye level.

“… *Okayyyy*. I see there are a few things we need to discuss.”

“I’m going to find someone to relieve you. Then we’re going to talk about inappropriate appearance around minors.”

The halfling shakes his head and walks away, mumbling to himself.

**Iron-Tail's Thoughts:**  
"{Hehehe... just can’t find good help...}"

Jenna pulls Iron-Tail away from the scene, heading toward their next destination.

“Oh my gods, *I cannot believe that just happened*. I pass that guy all the time at work. There was always something so *creepy* about him, though I couldn’t put my finger on it. Then he goes and pisses himself right after trying to fight you? Did he get too excited or something? Omigods, like, *gross*!”

Jenna links arms with Iron-Tail as they laugh about the whole exchange.

The jacket proves to be a good choice; it feels nice and toasty this time.

The girls continue on, occasionally stopped by men trying to flirt and invite them to carnival games. Politely refusing, they finally procure their drinks and head back to the group.

------------------------------
##### 3rd Punch: The Merc Who Stayed

While you’re enjoying your time as ‘Mr. Playground’ with the children, you catch sight of something out of the corner of your eye. You hope you're mistaken, but no, you’re right. It’s unmistakable.

At the dart throw stall, it’s ***one of the two mercenaries from before.*** A human with a big, bushy beard. It looks like he’s on a date, with his companion holding a large teddy bear and seeming to have a good time.

You know it's only a matter of time before Yarl notices him. You're uncertain how Yarl will react with so many kids and witnesses around.

You remember his threat:
"I see any of you two again - passing in the street, off chance in a tavern, ***I break you***. Then and there."

Given his reputation for keeping his promises and threats, you need to decide your next move. Should you distract the group, inform Yarl, or handle the situation with the same respect you showed the scarred veteran Torgon?

"Excuse me, children, but I see an old friend I need to speak with. I’ll be back shortly."

You gently set the airborne children down and walk towards the mercenary and his date. With a polite smile, you address the date.

Onager
“Excuse me, miss, but may I borrow your companion for a moment?”

Bearded Merc
"Wha-"

You guide the mercenary the arm a few feet away, maintaining your smile as you glance back at his date.

“The Yarl is a spear’s throw away and will certainly at least cripple you if he sees you. My suggestion is that you inform your young companion of an urgent matter and that you must depart. Stay at your own peril.”


Onager makes an announcement loud enough for his date to hear.
“I must return to the children. Apologies for the ill tidings. Do take care.”

You release his arm and casually head back to the waiting children.

Returning to the heart of the festivities, you glance back. The woman is holding her teddy bear, searching for her bearded companion who has left earlier than planned. You wonder why.

“Onager, where did you go? You were gone long enough for the little ones to find someone else to bully. They’ve chosen me as their latest target.”

The young half-orc girl tugs on Yarl’s arm with surprising strength, forcing him off balance.

“My, aren’t you str**oh gODS**.”

“…Onager, I see the strength starts at a young age.”

The two women of the group return with as many flagons as they can carry.

“We’ve returned! The day is saved!”

The group cheers. Everyone takes a flagon, and the positive energy returns.

The rest of the night becomes a blur of ale, heavy bardic bass, and cheerful orchestration.

-----------------------------------
## **The Morning After**

**Caerne Camp**  
**Sunrise**

The camp is a chaotic mess.

Couples and new friends are scattered throughout, with tents toppled over and strangers sleeping _on top_ of each other.

Yarl is tightly wrapped with rope around a tree branch nearby.

Dr. Derby, dressed in Yarl's battle leathers and helmet, is cozily nestled on top of Yarl's tent, accompanied by a beautiful half-elf woman no one recognizes. She’s wearing Onager’s ‘Udo Uniform,’ which drapes over her like a bed cover.

Jenna is peacefully sleeping in her pajamas, on top of a still-active campfire.

Onager is buried under a pile of water buckets, with four halflings in their boxers playing cards on top of him. The stakes: Each other's clothes folded and stacked in a neat pile.

Iron-Tail, smelling of fish, is curled up with a pumpkin. Someone has painted Yarl's face on one side of the pumpkin and Dr. Derby’s face on the other.

Kaelrith is awake, cooking several egg spinach omelettes. Her makeup makes her look like a clown.

A silhouette casts a shadow over Kaelrith as she cooks. She turns to see:

A young catfolk beastman and a gorgeous elven woman in white clothing.

**The Tabaxi (aka Leonin):**  
"See? We’re away for a big correspondence, and look what happens."

**Kaelrith:**  
“Oh, Anna. You’re back. 

I’m making breakfast for everyone. We got a bit wild last night, celebrating the addition of our newest member, Jenna. She’s a Firefolk. A bit shy, but you’ll like her. Doesn’t carry that stink, if you know what I mean.”

“So... how was it? Did it go well?”

The Elf speaks in a magically quiet tone, as if muffling the bird calls of the morning under fabric.

“…Gather the Band.

**...We’re to meet with a king.”**



In the distance, Yarl’s voice rings out:
{What the—Who did this!? Someone get me out of this bullshit! How did I get here? Help!}

## End of Act Zero
