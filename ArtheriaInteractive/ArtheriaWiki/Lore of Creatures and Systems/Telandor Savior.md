The Telandor Savior is the name given to a mysterious titan. It was [[Iron-Tail]] that named it that.

It looks like a knight frame, standing 10 feet tall. It's large enough for Iron-Tail to stand in.

The titan looks to be of Elvish Technology, but from thousands of years ago.

"Telandor" is Elvish language for Iron. "Savior" is exactly that in Common.
