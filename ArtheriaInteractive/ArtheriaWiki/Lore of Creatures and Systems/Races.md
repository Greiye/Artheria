### The Elven

The elves originate from a primitive homeworld, where their long lives, spanning over a thousand years, have given them the privilege of witnessing countless events that shaped their history and culture. Among these pivotal moments is the creation of humans, a race whose uncanny resemblance to elves—aside from their ears and height—has left the elves both intrigued and unsettled.

The elves, fiercely proud of their heritage, have produced literature of unparalleled quality. Scholars and archaeologists regard their texts as invaluable, meticulously researched, and a testament to the elves' dedication to cultural and historical accuracy.

#### The Creation of Humans and Elven Seclusion

After humans appeared in the world, the elves began to retreat into isolation. The unfamiliarity and strangeness of humans, who looked so much like them yet were different, fueled their fear of the unknown. This resemblance, compounded with the elves' inherent distrust, drove them to live in remote, protected villages and towns. These settlements are nestled in hard-to-reach locations, originally chosen to defend against ancient predators. Over time, magic became a second line of defense, shielding them further from the outside world.

The elves are known for their long memories and unyielding nature, bearing grudges that can last centuries. Their relationships with other races reflect this:

- They attack **beastmen** on sight.
- **Humans** are dismissed as "inbred elves" and generally regarded with disdain.
- **Orcs** are seen as ancient enemies, raiders of elven lands in the past.
- Though they find **tieflings** visually unappealing, elves enjoy deep conversations about magic with them.
- **Halflings**, with their 400-year lifespan, are regarded as kin, though elves consider them undisciplined compared to their own.



#### Elven Society
and Interaction with the Outside World

Elves who live among other races are viewed with disdain by their secluded brethren. They see city elves as tainted by the "inferior" cultures they live alongside. Despite this, city-dwelling elves play a crucial role in keeping their isolated kin informed of the continent’s news. This dynamic creates a strange contradiction, as the so-called "pure" elves rely on those they scorn for information about the wider world.

Internally, many elves struggle with their identity, caught between their ancient traditions and the inevitability of modernity.


Elven Society in general

Elves don't traditionally build in the middle of nowhere. They find a mana source and live close to it in a cave. The less unnatural construction the better, but elven made construction is not ruled out. 

Elves will then create whatever structure they need to maintain the mana ecosystem. They will protect the animals and the trees, and stop any threat from poisoning or killing the mana source.

Elves prefer harmony with their environment, but also understand necessity. They have the infrastructure that you can find in any other society. Waste management, agriculture, etc. 

The population is kept low and constant as to not affect the mana source. There are population failsafes, such as child licenses and exportation in the event of too much or too little. 

With the threat of other sentients destroying their way of life, the elven people founded the capital. It is their most advanced society made with the technology of a bygone era. The capital mana source is artificial, and therefore looks less natural than the other elven settlements.

### Elven Duty
"Protect the Manasource." Elves learn their community mana source. They are taught to protect it from outsiders. At first they report the threat to the council, then a team is dispatched to watch them. If they are planning to negatively affect the community , they are sabotaged. The watch team is to hide their presence the entire time, stealing their tools in the night, setting up traps that will lightly hurt them and keep them from going on. Using toxic plants and animal stampedes. Stealing food, and water. Poisoning the food and water to make them sick enough to leave. If they escalate, the watch team escalate as well, scaling up. The entire time they are to hide, or write threats in human/ orcish language. They are not to even know they are against elves. If discovered, the watch team should not report back until the threat is handled, on threat of community discovery. Only one member can return, unfollowed, until the threat is handled. 

The very moment that an elf dies is the moment that the threat is to be directly destroyed with the help of the entire commune. 

### Societal Customs

1. Mammal Birth
	1. Elves give birth like any other mammal. They need a touch of natural mana as well.
2. Community Care
	1. The Community cares for the young while the parents help the commune. 
3. The First Spell
	1. Elven children mature slowly, compared to humans. Humans are derived from elves, living at 10x the pace. In their first 3 years, humans learn to walk and talk, whereas with Elven children it's something like 30 years.
	2. With their tie to magic, Elven children often learn how to manipulate magic before they can talk. How this 
4. Giving to the Community
	1. Even at a young age of 30 to 130 years old, children who want to help the community can. Often it's just clean up or supervised collection of materials. Helping the community is paramount. There are even stories of parents having to wake up late at night from meditation when their child is in the mood to pick up trash. 
5. The Scribe Classes and Place in the Ecosystem
	1. as soon as 60 years old, elven children are taught the world. They learn quickly about magic and their world. They are primed to go explore if need be to the other settlements. A road trip may be initiated to visit other elven settlements. This continues until they are about 170 years old.
6. Fend for yourself, Pilgrimage
	1. Elves learn combat when they begin to get rowdy and aggressive to other children, usually ages 60 to 120. Often their final test is to hunt an animal. If the animal is killed, They must process every single part of it and not let it go to waste. If captured, it is to be tamed. If all taming techniques exhausted it is released.
	2. At age 170 they are formally taught advanced combat techniques to defend themselves and then their community. They are taught the threats of the world, the combat styles of other races, offensive magic. Training is strict and disciplined. The reward is that when it is time to fight, The community fights as one.
	3. A rite of passage; An elf should find their place in their ecosystem; Elven Society. When an elf is 200 years old, they should leave and explore the world. An elven pilgrimage group is very common, something like 4 or 6 close friends travelling together to work or sightsee in other elven societies. It's uncommon for a young elf to forego the pilgrimage.
	4. Pilgrimage groups explore elven lands, fostering elven inter-settlement relationships.
7. Finding a mate, living your life
	1. Elves are encouraged to find another elf to be mated with. Those who mate with another race are likely excommunicated. It happens usually when an elf is young. It is treated on a case by case basis.
	2. Elves consider the ages 200-900 to be their golden centuries. by 180 years, they will look the same all their years. Perfectly symmetric, clear skin with no moles, thick hairs. It's their mana that can change throughout their years. Other elves have a sense for the mana. dubbed the 'Elven Sense'
8. Returning Home, Settling down for a family
	1. Elves often settle down in their home community around ages 500 or so. They start families. There is a Settling ritual as well. Other elves build their homes for them. After that, they meet up with the Commune Council to volunteer, see where they are a best fit.
9. Community
	1. Just community work. It's every branch of infrastructure maintenance.
10. Writing your journey and contributing to the library
	1. Elves at age 500-800 are encouraged to write down their life. They are also encouraged to write down whatever useful information they've discovered and submit it to the capitol. The information is sorted. If the capital needs more info, they will send someone from the capitol to record more information. 
11. The Passing and the End of Cycle
	1. Elves disappear slowly. Often they have written down who in their family gets what in their will.


#### Mating Ritual
It's an intricate ritual that uses a lot of magic.


#### The Elven Capital
and the Structure of Knowledge

At the heart of elven society lies the **Elven Capital**, a sacred city believed to be the landing site of the Travelers who first arrived on Artheria. Underneath the capital is a maze of tubes and objects which houses the Capital source of mana.

Central to the city is the **Grand Academy**, home to a mysterious **metallic structure** covered in rust. It is thought to contain the knowledge of the Fairies and Elven Ancestors. Guarded by a battalion of metal golems, the structure can only be accessed by Elven Royalty, who wield a special **circlet** granting control over the golems.

In elven history, it is recorded that a queen once ventured inside the structure using a second circlet—the Queen’s Circlet—only to vanish, never to return. Archeologists speculate that part of the structure collapsed, trapping and killing her. Fearing the loss of another key, no king has ever dared to follow her, as losing the final circlet would mean losing access to the structure forever.

There is a theory among elven scholars that a fairy might have been able to bypass the golems without a circlet. However, with the extinction of fairies, that option has also disappeared.

The Capital is hidden away, accessible only by full flooded elves. There is a thing of spirit or genetic code that physically barred any other race from entering the capital. Half elves are also cut from entering the capital. It is uncertain what happens to other non-elves that pass the barrier.

The Capital Spies make sure through disinformation to keep the Elven Capital a secret. Any elf that reveals the location of just the border of the capital is to be destroyed without a trace, their fate spread through misinformation.

In classes, elves are taught to only speak of the capital with several layers of security, with only those they trust. They must never speak of it in the presence of other races, especially orcs, in any circumstance. Layers of security could mean magical tools that replace what the speakers are saying, and the elvish language dialect .


### Elven Royalty
King, Queen, Princess, Princes, some Knights. It's a tight family.

### **Societal Structure**

- **Government**:
    
    - **Type**: Theocratic Monarchy.
        - The Elven King rules over the elven capital, but power is decentralized in smaller settlements. Local leaders often include spiritual leaders, mana guardians, or elders, acting as community heads.
    - **Leadership**: The King has access to the **metallic structure** containing ancient knowledge, guarded by golems with the Final Circlet. The King holds immense power through control of the golems but is primarily a ceremonial figure. Local councils and communes make day-to-day decisions for smaller elven settlements, prioritizing mana preservation and community harmony.
    - **Roles in Society**: Leadership positions are often hereditary but can also be earned through exceptional magical prowess, wisdom, or contributions to elven culture. Scholars, mana guardians, and those who protect the environment hold high status.
- **Hierarchy**:
    
    - Elven society is relatively egalitarian within settlements. Elders and mana specialists are highly respected.
    - **City Elves** are seen as lesser by their more traditional kin, given their close interaction with human society.
    - Elves who mate with other races are often excommunicated.

### **Economy and Trade**

- **Economy**:
    - Elves maintain small, self-sufficient populations to prevent strain on mana sources. They focus on agriculture, waste management, and maintaining their settlements.
    - **Artisan Work**: Elven crafts, including literature, textiles, and magical artifacts, are highly prized in trade with other races. They rarely engage in large-scale trade, preferring to sustain their own economy.
- **Exports**:
    - Elves export art, magic-infused items, and knowledge to the outside world. They may also allow select non-elves to visit their libraries to access ancient texts.

### **Military and Defense**

- **Defense**:
    - Archers, Spellcasters, Spearmen, Soldiers, Spellswords
    - Most elves are trained in **combat magic** and **hand-to-hand combat**, with a rite of passage involving the hunting or taming of animals.
- **Capital Army**:
    - Elves avoid large-scale warfare but protect their settlements with highly trained magical warriors. Mana sources are defended with deadly efficiency.
    - The **Elven King’s Golems** provide additional protection for the capital.
    - The Capital Army is not an invasion force, it is a militia with the strength of an army to protect the capital from an invasion or disaster that threatens their library and mana source.

### **Culture and Arts**

- **Literature**:
    - Elven texts are regarded as the highest form of literature, filled with centuries of knowledge, history, and cultural traditions. They prioritize factual accuracy and often write for both future elves and the scholars of other races.
- **Music and Dance**:
    - Elves cherish slow, methodical music and ritualistic dance, often used to celebrate the changing of seasons or significant life events, such as the **Passing**.
    - They also learn of the customs of other cultures and dances, with the mindset that to know your enemy is to be able to crush them.
- **Architecture**:
    - Elven architecture focuses on natural harmony, with structures built close to mana sources and made from local, sustainable materials. Their capital city, however, boasts ancient, artificially enhanced architecture with mana-powered designs.

#### Elven Magic

Elves are deeply connected to their environment. Over time, they absorb the elements of their surroundings, and their magic adopts the texture and color of the biomes where they were raised:

- **Desert elves** cast magic with a grainy, sandy texture.
- **Forest elves** have magic resembling leaves and twigs.
- **Dark Elves** cast magic that can't be seen, only felt like hairs raising on your neck.
- Marine Elf magic can be identified by the smell of salt and humid warmth.

This elemental connection is tied to their long lifespan, which is sustained by their relationship with **mana**. Elves do not age physically as humans do; instead, their mana ages, becoming weaker over time. In a sense, elves could be something like a quarter spirit, and 3/4ths an animal. They are both wandering spirits in a sense, but also an animal. 


#### Elven Death Process
By the age of 900, most elves lose their ability to cast magic, and by 950, their perception of time begins to blur. They gradually become ghost-like, with a glowing core, and eventually merge with their environment. **Wood elves** transform into trees, their skin becoming bark. **Tundra elves** crystallize into ice, and so forth.

The process of elven passing begins when an elf becomes intangible, with signs such as hands or objects passing through them. This phase of transition can last up to a week. During this time, the elf may sit, meditate, walk around, or speak calmly while their friends and family gather to say their goodbyes. Although the elf may not visibly react to their words, they can still hear their name being called.

Upon the elf's passing, their remains are returned to nature. A bonfire is lit, and their personal belongings are burned in the fire. The resulting metal and ash are collected and melted down, then passed to the next of kin. This ritual symbolizes the elf's return to the world through the cherished items they left behind, preserved by their loved ones. If the elf is alone, they must find a way to destroy their belongings and prepare for their passing without an heir to their artifacts.

### Elven Subcultures
Subcultures have their own dialects, which could be considered another language.


#### **Wood Elves**

Once the dominant line during the ancient purges, wood elves are adept at detection and stealth, with a mastery of ranged weapons like slings, arrows, and spears. Their magic reflects their historical need for survival in a dangerous world, where giant beasts once roamed beneath the trees.

#### **Dark Elves**

Living in the depths of caves, dark elves have developed a keen sense of touch and vibration, compensating for their poor eyesight. Their magic is exploratory, using magical tendrils to feel out their surroundings. They are expert spelunkers and hunters of cave-dwelling insects, surviving in a harsh and unforgiving environment.

#### **City/Capital Elves**

Capital Elves
These elves, for the benefit of the natural elves, have lost their connection. They are used to settlements, cobblestone roads, trade, and are no longer suited for the life among the elements and hunting. As a result, they are not as strong or as quick. But they are more knowledgeable, know more spells, and can use a variety of weapons in defense of their city. 

City Elves are not unlike capital elves, but are looked down due to their proximity to the other races. Having integrated into human society, city elves often face disdain from their more traditional counterparts. Though they adapt to modern life, their connection to their roots is strained, and they grapple with the tension between elven purity and the diversity of city life.

#### **Tundra Elves**

Residing in frigid, isolated tundra pockets, tundra elves draw their magic from the ice and cold around them. Their lives are harsh and solitary, with survival at the forefront of their existence.

They live in caves with igloos being their outside structures. Their diet is mostly fish caught in the ice.

#### **Desert Elves**

Desert elves thrive in arid regions, drawing strength from the sand and heat. Their magic has a gritty, earth-like quality, reflecting the harsh environment in which they live.

They eat mostly plants, insects, small mammals and carrion.

#### **Marine Elves**

Living near water, marine elves have adapted to the ebb and flow of the tides, with magic that mimics the fluidity of the sea. They live in harmony with the ocean and its creatures, often dwelling in coastal or underwater settlements.

They eat spearhunted fish, or underwater plants

Subculture Magic,

### Elven Fashion

Elven fashion reflects their deep connection to magic, nature, and longevity.

- **Wood elves** incorporate wood, plants, and leaves into their clothing, blending seamlessly with their surroundings.
- **Dark elves**, by contrast, focus on practical, combat-ready attire, using cave flora for survival in their subterranean homes. They dress in stretchy clothes, are amazing rock climbers, and know how to rappel.

## Beastmen
After the war along the giants in ancient history, Beastmen were hunted due to their former alliance with the giants. They took shelter in the wilds where no other race could survive. They fought with one another for leadership, but that endeavor has since dissolved as they adapted to their new surroundings.

Now the Beastmen have found purpose in taming animals and becoming close to animals that closely resemble them as well as other beasts. It is common for those from the feather clan to have a roost of eagles and falcons, and so on.

Every 4 years, beastmen from around the continent will travel to a competition sponsored by a beastman settlement to see who can win the beastman artifact for their tribe. The Artifact is a kind of cloak that signifies the clan that is most ready for war. The competition became a regular event to control the beastmen’s hunger for war, without reducing their already dwindling population.


The occasional beastman can be found in mixed society, but only if they are traveling with their ‘herd’ or ‘flock’. They are more trusted than orcs, but not by much. Still, if in need for a finely tamed creature, a beastman’s bond has no competition in quality.

##### Animal Tribe Features

Beastmen come in all shapes and sizes, living in tribes where the majority is one specific subculture of beast. The beast they have similarities to is the creature they worship. Their method of worship varies greatly between tribes. Some capture and release their totem as a rite of passage, some eat their totem. Often their totem is nearby or tamed into servitude, depending on the animal’s nature and chance of predating the tribe.

**Incompatible Genes**
Beastmen who try to procreate with another beast culture are met with disappointment. Their genes are not fit. Often these offspring are cast out. Some speculate that this practice is why there are so many odd creatures in the wilds.

## Halflings
For a time, halflings were resentful of their captors, the beastmen and the elves. But that dissent disappeared with time. As they live long lives compared to most other races, they have used that time to reflect and forgive. Most halflings live peaceful lives, drinking and eating for most of their days, stirring up good times with instruments in hand. This race works hard just as much as they play hard, spending 2 days of the week working tirelessly in the mines, inventing, and cooking up delicious food. Being natives of Artheria, they have the most knowledge of cuisine. All throughout the land, even in elvish society, they have restaurants that sell their food. Legend has it that a small number of large conflicts have been solved by a bowl of halfling stew.

As such, most other races leave halflings alone, actively seeking them out for recipes and cooking advice. But make no mistake, a halfling can be useful in situations that require a small body. Halflings have been known to join the Adventurer’s Guild for a more exciting lifestyle, specifically in asset recollection or exploration. A few halflings know their way around the blade.

## Humans
The most adaptable of the races, humans find their way into most societies as ambassadors. Much like the fairies, the majority of them learn their magic through using natural components and mana-infused items. Their adaptability has also led them to be conduits of magic, with the occasional human being able to cast spells from a magical deity or patron.
 Unlike their elven ancestors, the ability to manipulate magic does not come naturally to them. Although the ability to cast magic from within is still there, the occasional human being is able to do so after rigorous training and practice. 
Humans can be found living in almost every settlement of every race, their adaptability a universally prized trait. If a human is living among elves, their spellcasting ability must be greater than the surrounding elves. If they are living amongst the beastfolk, their relationship to animals must be practically magical. If a human amongst orcs, they must either be an outstanding fighter or just as merciless.
Humans are not only highly adaptable by behavior but by their genetic makeup. Records of Half-Orc, Half-Elves exist, as well as half-beastmen and half-tieflings, although with severe impairment. Half-Orcs and Half-Elves seem to be the most stable pairing.

Humans are the byproduct of Elves that were left alone to interbreed between themselves for millenia. Their crossbreed nature makes them adaptable.

## Tieflings
Born from the First Warlock, Tieflings are looked down upon in human society and attacked on sight by Orcs. Their name comes from a term meaning ‘low’ or ‘deep’, as if the power given to them comes from an obscure entity that clawled from the dark depths of a terrible place. They have inherited their magical ability from the elves as was guaranteed in the promise, at the cost of their appearance. They are regarded as ill omens, their dark magic a reason for vigilance and caution. Most uneducated people in smaller towns are afraid of them on appearance alone, much like orcs or beastmen.

**Appearance**
Tieflings on average, are humanoid.  Their height can be as tall as the elves, and as short at the halflings. They look like humans except for their horns, lack of immediately visible pupils. Their eyes are just bright colored schera. and bright skin color. Skin color can be red, blue, purple. Eyes can be red, blue, purple, yellow.

In the dark, their eyes glow when exposed to light. Like how animals eyes glow in the dark, except more pronounced.

Random Traits of Birth

Tieflings are born with various animal-like traits that appear demonic, adapted for a place of heat and/or combat. Their people see these as different signs, and closeness to certain demons that they believe in.

Different from

The Vast majority of Tieflings have Horns and a tail. very rare do they not. It is something like only 1% of the population. Some people celebrate this, other families who live in mixed societies find this detrimental.

Common Traits
- Tail and Horns
	- Rare cases of OR, as in not having horns but tail present and vice versa.
- Eyes
- Fire Resistance
- Demonic Language.



It is unclear which powerful entity their common ancestor gave his soul to, but a side effect of their gift is that they are strongly resistant to fire. A Tiefling can withstand boiling temperatures for hours and can even stand on fire for a long period of time before being burned.
They are resistant, not immune. Hot enough flames can still burn Tieflings.


If a tiefling is in a society that permits their residence, they are more often than not placed in the more dangerous part of town. Still, their resistance to heat makes them prized as firefighters. Their given talent for magic makes them excellent magic users, on par with elves. Unlike elves, the appearance of their casting is alarming. Their bright yellow or red eyes flicker with the shimmer of fire, their spellcasting voice deepens to an inhuman low pitch. Some say that the most powerful spellcasters dim the area of light, making their spells that much more intimidating.

**Dreams**
During their inception as a people, some tieflings report visions of crossing into the dark planes, soaking in the mana of dark spirits. Their skin can range from a bright red to purple due to the alien habitat they were forced to live in, A kind of place where birds, fish and reptiles thrived. The brightness of their skin displayed that they are masters of fleeing. Their horns, from the animals that butt heads. Their small control of fire and vestigial tails, a remnant of the cold dark place their former spirits chose to live in.



Magic Casting Appearance
The Majority of Tieflings cast magic

Propensity to Wizardry, Warlocks and Magic.
Because of their people’s relation to magic, the Tieflings have an innate call to the dark arts. Forces outside their understanding protect them. Their ancestor, the Scholar (Or First Patron?) had developed never before seen summoning magic. As homage to this, Teiflings use Alchemy circles as identifiers for each other. Their letter signatures are often their favorite alchemy circle.

The Deamon Relationship
Different Colors, Magic. All disturbing and aggressive. Unsettling. 

##### Leften Teiflings
Those who believe in a pantheon of gods. They embrace change through all mediums. They believe in improving the community as a whole and welcome outsiders to their folds.

##### Denrite Teiflings
Those who believe in a singular god. They keep to their own and are wary of change, believing in a simple lifestyle where each family is a community and should be capable of defending itself.

## Orcs
Orcs came into being from Humans. Humans used the knowledge of the fairies, using what they called ‘Ashen Magic’ to try and regain the ability to use magic. This was combined with the technology invented in Artheria. The spell ultimately failed, creating orcs. The spell corrupted the humans who ran the experiment, mutating them into a new type of sentient being.

Because of their degenerative bloodline, the majority of orcs are unintelligent and aggressive, making them the most despised of all the races throughout the land. They are unwelcome in most societies, the intelligent ones having to cover the color of their greenish skin.

The only accepted orcs are those of nobility, well known throughout the land as charming, strong, intelligent individuals capable of anything they set their endeavors on, provided they show proof of legitimacy. Often these nobility will go out of their way to dress in the best quality garments or armor they can find, decorated with their house’s symbol.
Despite this, Tieflings still look down upon them as much as other societies look down on them due to the current war.

Fighting an orc in combat is just as dangerous as fighting a wild animal, their natural physique letting them fight longer than even beastmen.

Orcs are often vying to show who the most capable house members are, joining any competition that will bring honor to their name. Some orcs attribute this to their nature, saying that even the most unintelligent orc wants to prove their might in combat for their tribe.

Orcish Colors
Skin can range from Human colors to dark green, almost black olive skin tone.
Degenerate Orcs choose to wear what is available. Their ripped clothing and discarded armors are stolen and poorly sewn together.

Noble Orcs choose to adorn their bodies and jewelries with colors that match their skin tone. Major colors are red, orange, brown, gray and gold.

Because of their population being majority degenerative orcs who are more brawn than brain, the Noble orcs (despite their Intelligence and mental adaptability on par with Elves), must prove their strength to their warring kin. Their armor is fierce, often blood soaked, battle worn and depicts the brutalism of war. The most savage of Orc tribes will have flags of living enemies, with limbs broken, their skin flayed, etc. kept alive until a suitable replacement can be broken down and dismembered in front of enemies.

The Noble Orcs in discussion with other intellectuals, despise this method of control. But better they do this, than someone who does this in joy. It is a necessary evil in the most brutal of Orc clans.

The more civil orc clans merely wish to display their strength amongst each other. Some Nobility were successful in channeling their habits to constructive events such as sports rallies. Thus, they can be crowned the strongest in a division, their competitiveness slaked.

Other Races
Because of ‘The Promise that Shattered the World’, other races have been documented traveling Caerne. Some come from the portals that have opened all over the continent (known as Portalites). These races are often stared at, either from a place of intrigue or distrust.

Wherever they find themselves, people usually form their opinions of them from the local gossip.

## Extinct Races
### Giants
	Twice the size of even the largest of beastmen or orc, the giants were a fearsome force to behold. The Scriptures say that the giants were slave mongers, believing that the leader is supposed to rule with might. They had 6 fingers, like 2 middle fingers of any humanoid being. Bones like iron, and could crush the throat of an elf with just 3 fingers.

The Giants went extinct during the Frozen Struggle, when the other races banded together to destroy them. Only scraps of information about the giants exist. One notable excerpt is that during the migration (before the Era of Ice), the Giant Soldiers always came from the North.

Similar to humans except their hands have six fingers, their bodies like wood. Savage sentient creatures that think of war, and do not believe in diplomacy. Their culture breeds the best warriors. Their culture has led to their numbers dropping. Estimated population is something like 5,000. They travel and live off giant animals. Their technology because of their culture has stayed in the Stone Age. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.


### Fairies
	The fairies were small, ferociously intelligent creatures that could sit on the palm of an elf’s hand. They had 4 wings like butterflies, except much thinner and longer.

These humanoids could cast spells with ease. Archeologists assert that the wings may have been vestigial, and that their wings were like sails that flew on the invisible currents of mana all around them.
It is documented that during ‘the passage’, the fairies lost their ability to fly. They also slowly lost their link to magic, their spells getting weaker and weaker as time went on. This could have been a potential catalyst to create technology that did not depend on one’s innate mana amount to function. They are a First Race, existing before the great migration.

An interesting excerpt about the fairies is that in ancient times, savage tribes would capture and grind up the fairies alive. When the fairies were killed in this way, bright lights of various colors would blast from their bodies, as well as emitting a stunning force that could knock out a grown man. This mixture would then dry for some time. Beastmen and Giants would snort this Fairy Powder, permanently imbuing them with the ability to use mana and cast spells at an unprecedented level.

The surviving tomes show diagrams of a single powerful fairy lifting giant trees and boulders using magic alone. The same diagram also shows giants burning freshly cut trees to smoke them out.

### Changelings
Elven books say that for a short time, a small group of sentient humanoids existed along with the first giant and the first man. These creatures were called changelings, having the ability to change their appearance and genetic makeup at will to better adapt to their environment. Within a short time (days or weeks), Changelings could alter their teeth to become carnivorous or gills to breathe water. Most believe they are the proto-types of all races. Only scraps of information exist about them, some going as far as saying that they’re works of fiction by an ancient elf writer. If they did exist, they were left behind in the migration.

### Spirits
Not exactly a race per se, but beings of pure mana that needed very little to survive. These spirits enveloped the first world, becoming living creatures once their form permanently stabilized. The books say some of them never changed form, drifting among other spirits that did stabilize.

Ancient elven books say that these spirits could have ranged from the size of an ant to a creature that stood above the largest of forests.
