| Old Gods        | External          | Forgotten Gods who still contain their power, but have lost physical state. Their power is summoned through the mana in flora and fauna. Associated with Druids. They control the world through animals and what others deem natural occurences. Associated with Elements Ice, Water, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| New Gods        | External Faith    | Gods whose names are known through society. They can have a physical form like the old gods, but can take shape near their disciples. Those who call themselves scientists believe that gods are a parasitic entity that can attach to hosts via radiation. Thus, why they force their believers to always have their trinkets on them. These new gods do not have the mana mastery of the old gods, and thus cannot affect plants and animals. Gods do not have to be good or evil, and have an alignment. |
| Patrons         | External/Internal | Similar to new gods, patrons are like lesser gods. They have great power, but do not have the capacity for thousands of followers. Instead, they can take the form of cults, their power passed to a certain few. The power passed to the few, enhance their abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Wizards         | External          | These scholars use the knowledge of those who practiced their trade before them. They are close to scientists, in how they take measured approach to coaxing mana from everyday materials and ingredients. They themselves have no more magical power than the common person. Also there are many tales of wizards bearing sorcerer children due to mana proximity. Magic from Knowledge, Materials<br>Can use Runes, Scrolls, Etc.<br>Study of Magic                                                       |
| Sorcerers       | Internal          | Sorcerers are known by many names. Witches, Freaks, etc. They draw their power from within, needing no external source. Some of these sorcerers can become patrons or even gods themselves. It is very common for a sorcerer's first ability to be telekinesis or to produce a spark. When this rite of passage has been achieved, good willed folks will consider them magic users, and not simply magic sensitive.                                                                                        |
| Blood Hunters   | Internal/External | Common people who have had different types of mana inserted into them either from surgery or procedure of events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Magic Sensitive | Internal          | At the cusp of being a sorcerer. Often Magic sensitive people report being able to use a bit of magic, but not well, and not consistently. The common magic sensitive person can at best make metal a little hotter than usual, with that one ability often being their only ability.<br><br>Still, all magic sensitive have a sense.<br><br>Animals can be magic sensitive.                                                                                                                                |
| Common          | Internal          | Everyone has a bit of mana in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Non-Magical     |                   | Aberrants in the way that they hold no mana. Often this means that they are necromantic. It is not normal to have absolutely no mana in one's body, as it is seen to be the world's life force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

###### A Story of a Wish
'Wish' is considered to be the 10th and ultimate spell level.
> 'The sage saw it once. The form that the enemy's Wish took.
>  It wasn't like her master said, it wasn't a bright light that blinded everyone.
> It was a faceless wraith, with warm candles floating all around her. She summoned a ghostly blue fabric, and began to cut it with scissors. with every cut, the world around her blurred, and she questioned her surroundings. The soldier who were in front of her changed numbers, then faces and armors. The ruins became clean, bright and blue. With every press of her scissors into the ghostly fabric, it changed like a new painting. dilapidated and old. then crumbled and burning. Then moss in every direction.
> 
> When the sage talks of it, she was certain that it was what she saw. She felt her strong, scarred hands suddenly shrink and become supple. Her height shrink down. Her horns disappear, her ears snapping to a shorten length.
> 
> When they left to go home, she wasn't sure that it was her home. She knew the way, kissed her husband. But he looked different. His soul felt the same; It was everything else around them.
> 
> She was the only magic user in her platoon. A secret she kept. As she lives her life, she wonders if it was just a dream, or maybe she's still in the dream.'

###### On Patrons
The usual story is that a warlock makes a promise with a demon, and this demon gives them a fraction of their power. In exchange for this power, the warlock is compelled to do the demon’s bidding. Often this demon is godlike, untouchable by the warlock.
But what if that’s not the case? What if the demon is made vulnerable, just as much as the warlock? As if the promise goes both ways?

Introducing the Lesser Demon’s Pact: The Magic of Knowing a Demon’s True Name.
Magic of True Name - A rare ability that can control the demons unleashed during ‘The Promise that Shattered the World”. When someone speaks the demon’s true name, their spells are counteracted. If a pact is made, then the player gains their abilities and spells, becoming a Warlock.


DM:
Magic casting is unique and fun. Make it as unique as possible.

An Elven opinion on magic
> Magic is an incredible thing. To this day, my people are still studying it, still trying to understand how it can exist how it does. The Humans have gone and done something with it, but not to the scale that we have, We have experiments that are ongoing for the past hundred years, the lead arcanist cannot be replaced. No other race can do this.
> 
> The magic affects us in a way the other races cannot understand. How do you explain 3 dimensions in a 2 dimensional setting?

My elven brethren say it is a wonder to cast, as familiar and filling as mother's soup when you're feeling sick. It's not wonder the other races will go so far as to sing its praises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It's like willingly holding on to a hot pan and getting angry that it's so hot, then using that anger to strike your enemies. It's a pain to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Necromantic Magic (from a Necromantic God)**         | Appears as: Purple/Black                                                         |                                                                   | Like breathing in dense fog and tasting bugs in your breathe. It's wet, and disgusting. Sprinkled soil sticking to your wet shoulders. As the spell grows stronger, it's like sticking your hand in your dead dog's throat and feeling its gastric juices. Whenever I cast it, there's a sense of dread in the air. Yes we elves can see in the dark, but there's a limit. I imagine this magic is like that. The darkness. Along with the smell of your dead dog's stomach at your fingertips. It's dirty. |
| **Nature or Fey Magic (from an older/nature/fey god)** | Appears as: Green/Brown/Blue or Clear                                            |                                                                   | It's refreshing at times, but dirty in a sense. It's beating the dust off your bed duvet, washing it, then letting it dry in the sun. When the day's gone, it feels clean, fragrance of linen, and well worth the effort. The problem was the effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Source of Mana                                         | Determines the color or hue of the magic (e.g., blue, green, red).               |                                                                   | I once met a human whose spells were all red, despite having no ties to any demons. Turns out he was a sorcerer, and he copied his Tiefling master's spells.  As he got older, the spells he learned became more aggressive. War spells. People kept calling his abilities the work of demons. It turned from purple to red. Color isn't the only indicator of a source it seems.                                                                                                                           |

#### Fragments of Magic (Hard System)
How Magic Works
In Artheria, magic is still largely unknown, even by those who study it
There are various organizations studying it to this day. Libraries, Guilds, etc.
Some societies use it as a power source
It seems to be present in all things, living or nonliving
Sentient creatures can control it at will, specifically those that can communicate with spoken language.
Some non-sentient creatures can still use magic, although primitive methods.





About a 1/10th of the world can cast magic. In Order:
Elves
Tieflings
Other Races
Humans
Halflings
Orcs
There seems to be a limit to how much magic a person can use in a set amount of time. Any more, and they experience Mana Burn.




Wizards use ingredients to cast magic
Some advanced wizards have a spellcasting focus where they can cast prepared ley lines that float in the air or ground. The leylines project from the spellcasting focus.
Certain Wizards will mark or tattoo alchemical symbols on their skin and hands to help with the spellcasting.

Clerics and Paladins usually have to speak and are bathed in a godlight when casting spells
Violent magic can alter the spellcaster’s eyes.
Druidic Magic is often very quiet. There is an element of visual trickery.
Demonic Magic is very unpredictable.
Tiefling Magic almost always darkens the environment and has a verbal component to it that lowers the caster’s voice to an unnatural degree.


Odd, Unusual Forms and Systems of Magic
Hard Magic - Lots of rules on how the magic comes to be. There is satisfaction once the spell has been cast.
Soft Magic -Magic happens without explanation or rules. Can be used as a justification of the impossible.


Abstract Concepts of Thought, in Real World Flesh Avatars. These avatars are slaves to the wizard, and try to break free. When the control is broken, the Binding cannot be done in the same fashion. The Concept remembers this binding and is summoned without limitation into the world. Often, the spellcaster is killed. The Avatar does not live long and is usually dispelled after some time. Seconds to days, not shorter than a few days.

Spells from plant seeds.

Magical Ability comes from a physical ailment. A person with scoliosis can turn to a snake. Often it is linked, but can take different forms.

A series of spells in the ringing of bells.

Shadow magic
The second type would be the spiritshadows, which are bound to each individual inhabitant of the Castle soon after their birth and again when they come of age. The shadowguards for children are able to alter their shape in various useful ways and serve to protect them until they come of age and bind their own personal spiritshadow. Big spoilers ahead for those who haven't read it. The spiritshadows are actually magical creatures from another world/dimension. The Castle inhabitants can use their light magic to send their spirits to this world, and while there they find a magical creature and use a mixture of light magic and the third magic to bind the creature to their shadow. The creature then returns to their world as their new spiritshadow, losing certain aspects and abilities but gaining others (like the ability to feed off light to grow stronger and regenerate). Many of the creatures have powerful abilities and magic themselves, and sometimes parts of that carry over into their shadow form. (For instance, since they were originally made of cloud creatures, Storm Sheperds can still alter their shape somewhat, unlike most adult spiritshadows, and use shadow lightning bolts.)

The idea of spirit shadows means there are soulbinders. People who go out looking to turn these sentient creatures into artifacts.

Simple Lineage Magic. Bakers, whose magic lies in their bodies. Their sweat and skin has magical properties that makes their bread delicious. Quite useless in most scenarios.

Magic from dietary consumption. Magic Eaters or something.

Magic from Powders thrown or applied.

Magic that only happens in the right environment. Such as a powerful lightning storm only on a cloudy day with someone who’s blood is of a powerful mage in the past.

Demon Friendship.

Magic from Language

Spellthief- Renders another spellcaster unable to cast the spell.

Cultish Favor from a corrupt, forgotten god.
