19JA1: Scorched Earth (October 9 2022)

## Mending the Royal Tapestries’s loose threads

Dark skin like cooled lava. veins of molten earth. A doubled sided ax hangs on his shoulder blade. With each exhale, the warmth of campfire flows from his breath.  

Standing along 6 feet tall, a hulking man, cut from the very volcanoes around him, walks the perimeter of ***Amethyst Peak***. His home. The City of Dragons.

*This is a day like any other*, thinks Biliran. *Once again, a calm day. A clear sky, save for the occasional rider hiding amongst the clouds. No threat, no challenger, awaits me outside these stone walls.* 
*Once more, I survey no enemy.*

*I grow weary of this peace.* 

As Biliran walks closer to the front gates of his grandfather's kingdom, he spots a new sight. His attention is stoked.

An unfamiliar knight stands by the gates, watching him. All black clothing. black armor. Even one of his hands is black and shining like polished obsidian. This hand rests on a sword's handle, sheathed at his hip.

Biliran is closer now. The guards above the portcullis watch curiously at the interaction about to unfold.

There was a squire, in fact. Biliran didn't see him.  The squire is either a child or a halfling, hiding away behind the knight, away from Biliran's gaze. Seems the pair were waiting for him.

Biliran stands, shoulders wide, chin up. He looks slightly down at the black knight. His eyes meet the fire in Biliran's.

"Your grandfather, the King of Amethyst Peak, is waiting for us." The knight's voice is quiet. calm. sure. He makes no movements that would give away any fear. For a moment, this peaks Biliran's interest. The interest burns away as quickly as it came. A stranger comes to his home and tells him of his duties without so much as a proper introduction. This annoys Biliran. the veins of lava across his body flash for just a moment. He bites his tongue. Just who is this unnamed sword bearer? Without a nod, he makes his way to the throne room.

The knight and squire move together with Biliran. Biliran is a hothead; finding the lack of introduction like stain on his reputation, Biliran makes it a prerogative to avoid following the knight. As they both move toward the great hall, Biliran keeps him at the corner of his eye. Far enough so that others do not associate them together.

Amethyst Peak citizens either bow lightly at the sight of him, or give him a wide berth. A few times a citizen had bumped into Biliran. a few times their palms had been liquified and burnt off at the mere touch off Biliran's skin. A few times was enough for the citizenship to learn; 'To touch the Hellfire is to touch lava itself. Do not touch the Blackthorns, on pain of disfigurement.' 

Arriving at the great hall, Biliran is surprised by the new carpet laid out over the obsidian stone tiles. It's usually laid out in the event of expected company. Biliran steps onto the carpet barefoot, his feet sizzling into the carpet. Even shoes made of obsidian threads melt in a matter of months due to Bili's core temperature. It's the prolonged use and the trapped heat. the wear and tear. 

Teofilo, Biliran's Grandfather, sits at the throne. Biliran and the knight approach.

His greying hairs and aging lines do little to take away from his handsome face. If anything, they add to his maturity.

"Grandson, Petit Fils (Pronounced Pueti-fiis)! come! I have much to tell you!"

“...I am no longer king. 
Your uncle, Lance, was to succeed me. 
He is gone now.
Lancia is still away, at University.”

"I wish for you to get her. She will ascend the throne."

Bilirans veins soften in confusion. Then grow hot quickly.

"Grandfather (Grruunpear), I... this is not right. She is a child, she cannot lead the might that is our kingdom. Our enemies will see this as a weakness. My father should be the one to ascend, for the sake of the kingdom, the people."

"It is the way of our people. Lance is the eldest of my sons. Then their eldest."

Biliran's face grows hot.

“Grandfather, I believe that I, your hellfire soldier, am worthy of the throne. Instead of Lancia, who has not so much as seen an enemy. For the sake of our people our dragons, We cannot have the spearhead of our people be led by a non-combatant. A sheep leading lions?

I have proven myself in battle, the soldiers know me. If not my father, then It sh-"

"WE. will discuss this when you return. With Lancia. We talk with everyone involved present. Go. Take the portal. You are not busy now, yes? Having just returned from watching the perimeter, as you do?

The faster this is done, the faster we can talk of you succession, mon petite fils.”

“...Of course, Grruunpear."



“Boy.”

The booming voice of his father. Belial Blackthorn. Around his form, a neverending fire. He wears royal clothes imbued with magic that negates the burn. Yet the heat. It's unrelenting. To have Belial closeby is to have the sun at arms length. Bright. Hot. It's a wonder how King Teofilo can enjoy his tableside meals with his family.


“Father."

Biliran bows his head, put a fist across his chest.

"Grandpere sends me now to fetch Lancia. It's my first time to this academy. Any advice?”

Belial furrows his eyebrows.

“I’ve never gone there. Lancia is the first to go. I merely followed my brother's family when they were saying their goodbyes at the portal.

My brother wished this. I have prepared a guide to find the portal.”
Belial whistles.
“This is Sir Luka Celestine. His Squire, Arthur Aiden.”
King: “My little friend!”


Biliran leaves. He passes the black knight, still yet to introduce himself. He makes his way to the path.

Private talk with Father
“This is a chance for the throne. Kill the Knights. Kill Your cousin.

Biliran punches his father on the arm. His knuckles are now burned. singed.


Biliran talks to the knight and the squire. He threatens Arthur, with a booming voice tells him to not order him around.
The Plan: cross through the sulfur caverns. Reach Pele’s playground. Enter the portal.

Arthur squeaks at the heat of the caverns.

Luka raises the sword horizontally with one hand. The sword is made of glass.. He’s looking through it.

Biliran: “What are you doing?”

Luka: The Dragon Knights have earned enchanted weapons from the kingdom. This is made of dragonglass. It detects magic.”

The sword is greenish/bluish.
The way is dark. There are so many different routes that without the knight, anyone would have gotten lost. Biliran’s view is darting around.
Arthur is quiet, but one can visibly see that he’s being affected by the heat.
Luka” This has to be the way. This is the exit. I’ve been following the sword. But I don’t remember this stone figure.
The whole figure looks like a dragon head, the exit being the mouth of the dragonhead.
There is an inscription in a different language. Arthur reads it to Luka “Puff Puff”.
Biliran asks “Isn’t sulfur flammable?”


Biliran climbs up and sets alit the dragon’s nostrils. Along the way, he knocks a boulder down, attempting to hurt the knight and squire. He misses. The exit begins to light up. The noise and vibrations wake up the sulfur bats.

Battle.
Luka’s sword glows green.
Biliran smashes a bat into paste on the floor.
Arthur summons a spiritual weapon; another sword.
“Ill make quick work of these bats!” Biliran misses.
Arthur’s spiritual weapon keeps failing to summon.
Arthur summons a shield of faith to protect Luka.
Arthur summons spiritual weapon rods. They’re blue and see-through.
Biliran smashes and launches a bat to the ceiling. 

They exit the caverns.

Pele’s Playground.


A bunch of lava pools. Open sky.
Arthur summons a gray falcon familiar. It’s name is Millenia.
Biliran tries to knock Arthur into the lava pools.
The group finds a small lake filled with white light.
Biliran chucks a rock into the white lake.
Luka says to Biliran “Let’s return to the King.”
“You may not know who Biliran is. But he does not hold back. You need to come with me, or I go alone.”
While looking at them, he begins to walk backwards into the pool.
They both stop him. Arthur loses his footing. He’s thrown into the pool. Luka pulls Biliran out of the pool.
“What are you doing, why are you not following orders? You’re not even in line for the throne!”
Luka takes out his glass sword and points it at Biliran.
“As expected from the sun of the Hellflame.”
Biliran walks calmly a few feet away from Luka, his back to the Knight.
“You dare raise your sword to the son of the Hellflame? Me? Biliran? You would do best to sheath your sword. Knight.”
“Who am I? I’m one of the few greatest knights of Amethyst Peak. I’ve fought many to get to where I am now. I know who you are. You’re the son of the Hellflame. He’s never contributed anything as the king. It’s obvious he’s only there for himself. Why does King Filo continue to keep your father at his hand?.”

“Like father, like son. You’re going to be exactly like him.”

Luka brings out his sword.
Biliran is cut across the chest. Lines of lava spill out. His lava veins begin to expand throughout his body.

“YOU DARE!? WITH THE SON OF THE HELLFLAME!? I WILL BE SURE TO BRING BACK YOUR HEAD TO MY FAMILY, ASSASSIN.”



Luka adopts a fencing stance.
Biliran destroys Luka’s obsidian hand.
Luka: “I wish you were on our side.”

Biliran smashes Luka multiple times with his warhammer. Lava is pouring out of him, Even biliran’s slobbery spit is lava.

Luka is down. “I hate you.” He falls into a pool of lava.
Biliran screams out into the sky. His lava veins begin to cool. He falls to the floor exhausted. Luka’s dragonglass sword is close to Biliran.

Biliran picks it up. It’s changed. It’s now red. Looking throught it, Biliran sees an ethereal trail of which they previously followed. Biliran sees that the trail leads back to the castle.

Biliran examines his options. Return to the castle and report the assassin, or go through the portal.
Biliran cuts his waterskin into a sack and puts Luka’s smashed hand in it.
Biliran looks into the pool, pondering the adventure he may have through it. He sees students in uniforms.
“This must be Strixhaven.”
Biliran sees a female student with red hair. “It’s you. It’s Lancia.”
Biliran takes one last look around. He looks at the pool that Luka fell into, then hops into the pool, chasing after Lancia.

…
Arthur’s gray falcon, Millenia, is still around. It saw everything that transpired. It flies out from Pele’s playground, uncovered by the lava cavern ceiling. The falcon communicates with Belial. It magically relays what happened. King Filo’s mysterious secondhand man converses with Belial.
“What did he do?”
Belial: ”...Scorched Earth.”
