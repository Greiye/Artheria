                <h1>D&D Roll Table</h1>
                <p> This is a test of the DM's roll tables.
                    <br>This can be used for incredible rolls such as:
                    <br>Random Social Encounters
                    <br>Random Puzzle Encounters
                    <br>Battle Encounters (with some kind of filter fore region, dungeon location, etc.)
                    <br>Magic Occurrences
                    <br>Treasures
                    <br>Whatever Else you can think of that requires the randomness of dice rolls.

                <p>Mike's Advice;
                    <br>Once the party is formed, the DM's job is to simply throw challenges at them. See how they handle it. For the fun of it.
