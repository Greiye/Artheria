[[How to kill your players and NPCs]]


Rules of a DM

1. Have a setting and conflict.
2. Let the players decide the resolution
3. Make it about the players.



-------------------------

[[Friend Storytelling Request]]






How do I make people enjoy my story?
Make it relatable. Ask what the player’s favorite setting is. Then give it a twist. Some like the 80/20 rule, where the 80 is their setting, and the 20 is the twist.
Tailor it to their character. This is why a session 0 is important. When you know the character that they want to play, you can give them several challenges to test their player. Part of session zero is asking them 3 to 5 questions that give you an idea of the goal that motivates that character. I personally organize everything in 4 sections: Physical, Mental, Social, and Financial (Logistics). Do they want to become stronger to survive combat? Do they seek knowledge? Increase their magical ability? Find a Tutor? Learn more of the world? Do they want to protect someone that they know? Get powerful artifacts? Become rich?

All stories are tales of transformation. The character from the beginning of their story should be considerably different when their story ends. This is what makes a good story.

Where do I get inspiration from?
Any popular show that you like. There’s a section here to help you get inspired.

How to tell a good story (from various technique on youtube)
-Show, don’t tell. Use varying,  clever words.
-Use evidence to support your claims
-Make the readers want it. This goes back to the character, and seeing them change and grow.
-Concrete facts, not abstract feelings when describing the world. Bring the world out.

Inspiration for fellow DMs
It’s awesome that my friends are now joining me as Dungeon Masters (DMs) in our D&D adventures. I really like this.

I joined the D&D Club in high school for 2 sessions. We played the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition, and the club was exactly what one would expect: a gathering of high school outsiders. I vividly recall how we projected the battlemap on a screen, allowing us to visually track our characters' positions during combat.

I chose to play as a fighter, and at that time, my creativity was soaring. I was captivated by the limitless possibilities of storytelling. Artistry ran through my veins even then.

One day, on a scrap of paper, I sketched Veilo—an original character inspired by Vahn from the Legend of Legaia video game. The inner child within me yearned to shape Vahn into something beyond the confines of his virtual world.

Thus, I crafted a human fighter, equipped with unique weapons reminiscent of Vahn's tonfa. Through this process, I realized that, for the first time, I had the opportunity to bring forth a character entirely of my own creation—a character akin to the likes of Harry Potter or Bobby Pendragon from the Pendragon Series.


Then I remember playing my character in combat. I felt the anxiety of contributing to combat, wanting to do damage to the monsters we were fighting. The DM at the time made it feel so visceral, more damaging than anything I've felt in video games. It felt a little more real.

After the game, I felt that I wanted more. I want to develop my character, make him stronger. I went home that day, and drew my character a few more times, trying to make him more real. I was just a kid projecting, wanting to be a hero in my own story. That’s what most people want to be. The main character in their own novel.

The feeling persisted. Thus, my interest in game development. At the time, that was impossible, as I didn’t know coding was even a thing, or how a kid could start doing that with my limited resources. I thought you were required to go to school for that. Thanks to 2023 technology, everyone can just do it themselves on even a low-end computer.

Years passed after my first time geeking out with a bunch of high school punks with a paper and pencil, playing what felt like a video game without the controller. I tried playing the essence of a tabletop game again with Kuya. On roll20.net, I created a poor story and had Kuya play with me. He was a fighter that ended up talking his way out of a fight with a bear. I didn’t have a world, a ruleset or anything, so it didn’t feel like a real game. It just felt like pretending. 

Then, Kuya decided to buy the beginners set of DnD, 5th edition. That fueled my interest yet again. This time I spent hours going through the rules, learning what I could.

After 50+ sessions, I’m where I’m at now, and I’m still inexperienced. My creative ability has improved, yes, but it took time and a lot of errors. A lot of disappointing my friends with poorly written stories that made them fall asleep. Often I was disappointed in myself.

What makes it worth it though, is crafting stories and events that we made together. Where we can remember them like we do Harry Potter scenes. And I’m in awe of that. We made that. Together. It’s not planned. It’s all spontaneous. These scenes that could happen in movies, happen right here, in someone’s living room. WE did that. Together. It’s like we’re authors working on a story together, where one day it’ll end up on the big screen, like Critical Role.

That’s what makes it worth the hours of planning.

In my dreams, these stories take a comic book form, in all of our libraries. And when we miss each other or want to relive the events of our fictional selves, we can go through and read those books or novels.

There’s 3 factions
The Status Quo (Name WIP)
They want to keep things the same. The tech lives in harmony with the environment.

The New Era
They’re another political party that’s found another tech type. It’s more efficient than what they have, taking advantage of the environment’s many resources. (One of them is harvesting a non-magical crystal called Cabault.)

A third group wishes to combine both technology. Creating this tech will take time, and the other groups know this.

The Fog problem
In the distance, a large cloud that threatens to shut down all the power grid. It’s been recorded by flyers to be moving in their direction for the past few weeks. Samples are inconclusive as to how long it’ll stay in the air.
Status Quo says the residents just need to be patient.
New Era demands that they need to start adapting the new tech NOW, before it’s too late.
Third Group needs more samples. They can develop the tech, rig an inefficient system that will work. Cost is that the new tech will most likely be used up.

Both the Status Quo and the New Era have greedy entrepreneurs that benefit from either decision.

It falls on the party to find which is the best solution.
The solution will change their society forever.

## Adventure Event Checklist
For each adventure, give them 2 events per skill, for all skills.

In D&D 5e, saving throws typically counteract battle or spell effects rather than advance the story. To create a rich and engaging narrative, it's essential to incorporate various skill checks that drive the plot forward.
Story-Driven Skill Checks and Rewards


If skill <=, auto succeed. If not, roll die. 1 is injury.

##### Why bother will individual skill checks? when everything feels party-wide?
In D&D 5e, skill checks are traditionally made by individuals to reflect each character's unique abilities and contributions to the group. However, using party-wide checks can streamline gameplay and enhance teamwork. Here's a deeper look at why individual skill checks are still valuable and how party-wide checks can be effectively used.
Value of Individual Skill Checks

    Character Spotlight: Individual skill checks allow each character to shine in their areas of expertise, highlighting their unique skills and backgrounds.
    Diverse Challenges: Different characters may excel in different situations, creating a dynamic and varied gameplay experience.
    Roleplaying Opportunities: Individual successes and failures can lead to interesting roleplaying moments and character development.
    Balance and Fairness: Ensuring that each character has opportunities to use their skills can make the game feel more balanced and fair.

Effective Use of Party-Wide Checks

    Streamlining Gameplay: Party-wide checks can speed up the game, reducing the need for multiple rolls and keeping the story moving.
    Collaborative Storytelling: Treating the party as a single entity can enhance the sense of teamwork and collective achievement.
    Inclusive Engagement: Ensures that all players are involved in each challenge, preventing any one player from feeling left out.

Implementing a Hybrid Approach

To balance individual and party-wide checks, consider the following hybrid approach:
Individual Skill Checks

    Critical Moments: Use individual checks for crucial challenges where personal expertise is key.
    Role-Specific Tasks: When tasks clearly align with a specific character's skills (e.g., a rogue disarming a trap), use individual checks.
    Character Development: Individual checks that can lead to significant character growth or story development.

Party-Wide Skill Checks

    Common Challenges: For general tasks that the entire party can contribute to (e.g., group stealth, navigating terrain), use the highest modifier or an average roll.
    Group Decisions: When the party decides to work together on a challenge, allow them to pool their skills for a collective check.
    Routine Actions: For routine or less critical tasks, party-wide checks can keep the game flowing smoothly.
