## Chapter 1: Gorehouse Games

ChatGPT

The cheers echoed in the pitch-black darkness, drowned out only by the clacks of metal and screams that filled the air. The smell of urine, waste, and blood permeated the space, and a group of adventurers groped around, desperately searching for their weapons.

"We're not the only ones here... are we?" Privarax spoke, his voice tense.

A booming voice interrupted their conversation, announcing the next act with a confident tone. The crowd erupted in cheers, pleased with whatever gruesome spectacle was about to take place.

As a vertical slit of light opened up, revealing the surroundings, the adventurers could see they were not alone. The crowd consisted of humanoids of all shapes and sizes, including those with birdlike wings and feline features. Many of them wore tight leathers in shades of red and black, while others bore the symbols of the Tenth Precinct Guilds.

The blue-plated armor of an enormous man caught their eye as he prepared to fight for gold. Manfred cursed under his breath, and Asra thought of how she could use the gold to save those in need. Adresin was excited for the audience and commentators, while Sirrox saw the melee as a way for Ravnica to be reborn in blood.

Thanerus was skittish, and Sarovnek called on a dark spirit to keep them safe. Cyran scanned the other combatants, searching for vulnerabilities and a possible way out. Meanwhile, Dread was excited for the pain and agony that would please his lord.

As the chanting of "RAK-DOS!" filled the air, the show began, and the adventurers braced themselves for whatever gruesome events were to come.

Thunderous cheers can be heard in the distance, yet also all around you. Clacks of metal and screams. Is it due to pain? Pleasure? Or some mixture of both? 

You try to find your party through touch, as the darkness around you is pitch black. It smells of urine, waste, and a metallic smell you're far too familiar with. 

Blood.

----

Manfred gropes around in the dark.

"Where is it, where is it! Fern! My staff! Do you have it? Can you cast light?"

Tranquil Pond

"If we had any of our weapons, someone would have cast it long ago."

Privarax  
"We're not the only ones here... are we?"  
  
 A booming voice erupts, overpowering the cheers. 

Confident Voice  
"Well, well, well! Now that was a show! Can you believe that the Combine made such a… lovely and powerful abominationnnn?"

The cheers erupt louder, pleased by whatever event they watch transpire in front of them.

"And I thought we were savage." The voice chuckles. 

"Onto the next act!"

A vertical slit of light, about 50ft up opens up, revealing you and your surroundings.

You look around. It's not just you and your band. It's a crowd. 40, maybe 50 humanoids of all shapes and sizes.They must come from somewhere far away, save for those who wear symbols of the 10th Precinct Guilds.

Some in the crowd have birdlike wings. Some look related to felines. Cat people? They must be of Simic origin, not native to the Tenth. A few are wearing armor, but no visible weapons. This crowd seems confused.

Confident Voice

We've got quite a treat for all of you, dear patrons of the mighty Rakdos! For the first time ever, we’re Introducing people from all corners of Ravnica! Some came to us, some we liberated from their friends and family because why not? But ALL! THIRSTY! FOR GOOOOOOOOOLD!

Another cheer bursts from the crowd. With your eyes finally getting settled to the light, you see that most of the crows is wearing tight leathers colored in red and black.

An enormous man, wearing the blue plated armor of the Azorious stands brave, with his sword overhead. “Ha ha! When I win...whatever it is we're in, my followers will sing songs of my praise! Have at thee, boys!”

Manfred

Manfred squints as he looks around the newly illuminated chamber. "Aw, hells."

Asra

The gold will go towards saving the people who need saving...I can't die here. Not yet.

Adresin laughs raucously. “I was born for this! An audience and commentators? Prepare to be entertained!”

  

Tarlak

Foolish landwalkers. Come what may, I'll just fly over it.

Sybil simply brushes her hair back, and casts a serious gaze towards the crowd.

Fern blinks slowly. "A... performance? I don't know if I can do this..."

Sirrox  
“A savage melee... Yes, this is precisely what this world needs. Let all of Ravnica be reborn of this blood!”  
  

Thanerus seems skittish - an enclosed space makes him uneasy, plus the place reeks of death.

  

Sarovnek

“Dark spirit, whatever haunts me, I need your help. Keep me safe. Keep US safe.”

Cyran inspects the other combatants, eyes scanning for vulnerabilities and a possible way out.

Dread has never been more excited... so much pain and agony, his lord will be pleased.

"It'll be a lark, surely! They can't harm people on stage." Jeffram pronounces.

Worried

"... Can they?"

 Garreld hangs to the side of the crowd, internally panicking.

  

Garreth closes his eyes, sensing the flow of ki surrounding him and letting the distraction of the arena fade away

Confident Voice

Mighty Rakdos! May this... comedy... be to your liking! All Hail Rakdos!

Tarlak takes flight, hovering just above the others.

The Crowd chants his name. RAK- DOS! RAK- DOS! RAK- DOS!

Let... the show... BEGIN!

  

## Goal: Survive.

 ChatGPT

Tranquil Pond watched Garreth with serene eyes, mimicking the man's calm posture. He peeked through his eyelids to see if Garreth had noticed.

Suddenly, all the torches flared up, the crowd roared, and the music began to play. Popcorn, tomatoes, and fruit flew through the air as chaos erupted. The group was in a dimly-lit tunnel with an open ceiling, the ringmaster and crowd overhead. Darkness stretched out in both directions.

A rumble echoed from behind the group.

"By God," Garreldv said. "It's a boulder rolling straight at us. Run!"

The group sprang into action, sprinting away from the massive 50-foot metal boulder that threatened to crush even the strongest of Minotaurs. The crowd laughed and jeered, reveling in the adventurers' peril.

As the group ran, Privarax stumbled on a tomato in his path. He couldn't recover in time.

"No! Fern! Manfred! Please!" he cried out.

Two thuds followed, but the group didn't look back. One misstep, and it was all over for anyone.

"I knew it," Bharat muttered. "I fucking knew it. I knew I'd go out one day, just not-"

"Oh no!" Tim exclaimed. "I hate boulders!"

Bharat had been leaning against the sidewall, but his weapons made him unbalanced. He tripped over his garrote wire shoelaces and fell, another two thuds echoing behind the group.

For what felt like five minutes, the group ran at full sprint, with the crowd following them like a train on tracks. Finally, the corridor ended, and two pathways appeared. To the left were ant-like monsters with torches and spears, while goblins and minotaurs, twice in number, were to the right. The group had to decide quickly which way to go.

The boulder continued rolling toward them, and they had to make a decision. Those who chose quickly threw themselves to the left or right, prepared to fight to the death. But some couldn't decide.

Without a word, Thanerus grabbed Garreth and threw him to the left side. Garreth's body was crushed between the former stone wall and the boulder that imprinted into it. Murrah the Earth Genasi and Lysra the Goblin Ranger suffered the same brutal fate, along with a few others.

  

Tranquil Pond eyes the serene Garreth and emulates the human's calm posture, peeking out from closed eyes to see whether the man has noticed.

A flash of light as all the torches increase in brightness. Impending music plays. The crowd is cheering, throwing popcorn, tomatoes and various fruits at you and each other. Chaos. The group is in a semi-lit tunnel, with the ceiling open. The crowd and ringmaster overhead. Both ends seem to go on forever in darkness.

From behind the group, a rumbling sound.

Garreld

....holy shit.

...my darkvision is clear. IT'S A ROUND BOULDER COMING AT US RUNNNNNNNNNNN

Everyone springs to action.

The entire group sprints forward away from the rolling 50ft metal boulder, sure to press down even the strongest of Minotaurs.

The crowd is going nuts, laughing at the adventurers in peril.

  

As the group runs, Privarax trips. A tomato had found its way in his path. Not enough time to recover.

NO! FERN! MANFRED! PLEASE! HEEEEEEE-

2 thuds can be heard. But no one looks back. One misstep like that and it's all over for them, too.

  

Bharat

I knew it. I fucking knew it. I knew I'd go out one day, just no-

Tim: Oh no!! I hate boulders!

Bharat had been using the sidewall as support. But the weapons he stored all over his body made him unbalanced. Tripping over his garrote wire shoelaces, he falls. another 2 thuds can be heard.

The group runs at full sprint for what feels like a solid 5 minutes, the crowd seats following them as if on rails. Finally the corridor ends. Two pathways. To the left, Ant-like monsters with torches and spears.

  

To the right, Goblins and minotaurs, twice in number. Members had to decide which way to go, and quickly.

The boulder rolls forth. A decision had to be made. Those who came to a decision threw themselves as quick as they could to the left or right, prepared to fight to the death. And some could not decide. Thanerus, without a word, grabs Garreth and throws him to the left side. His body is pressed between what used to be the stone wall and the boulder that imprints into it. Murrah the Earth Genasi also meets the same brutal fate. So does Lysra the Goblin Ranger, and a few others.

### 32 Survivors Remain.

 Surrounded by strangers the group reaches the branching path. Everyone by themself but everyone is soaked in sweat. Lysra tried to cover in front of the boulder which was very goblinesque but resulted in goblin jam. Vesra shouts a battlecry, Asra hoping for the best wielding his rapier for his fortune. Tim and Misra are just silent, either worried or in Misras case indifferent to the death.

The adventurers look to the new threats before them. ...Only to see that the threats are just thick, paper cutouts with real weapons and torches attached.

The crowds cheers again.

OHHHHHHHHHHHH! Done in by something from a bedtime story! Whelp! that's just how our events do it. Anything goes in the name of Rakdos!

  

We'll be taking a short intermission, folks. Popcorn and Beverages for sale at the concession! 15 minutes, people!

The voice disappears. The cheers calms to a few conversations as the majority of them leave the stands for a moment.

The adventurers are left to themselves for a moment in this vicious, cruel show.

  

Jeffram pauses, bending over as best he can at the knee around his rotund belly to rest his hands on his knees. His face is pallid and clammy.

Suffering

Oh, spirits, so much blood... Keep it together, Jeffs... You can do this...

Next to him, Manfred is muttering obscenities as he catches his breath, paying no mind to the nauseated halfling.

“Those fuckwits had better not have broken my staff. Go on adventures, Manfred. You'll be the first to read the book when you find it, Manfred. WELL A GOOD FUCKING CHANCE I'LL FIND IT NOW.”

Adresin beats his chest impatiently: “Show me glorious combat! There is no entertainment in a fight against the arena, itself!”

Tranquil Pond glances at the elf, suddenly interested. His dark brown ears and whiskers point forward with intrigue.

  

You wish a fight, yes? Perhaps we... shall speak, should we both make it out of here. I find myself in need of a sparring partner.

  

Adresin: "Oh, I do not wish a fight. The gods will it! Would you be a fighter then, Leonin?"

Tranquil Pond: "I would... test my skills."

Adresin: "Ha! Precisely! A test of skill, of faith, of sheer will. We'll have our fight yet, comrade."

  

Annoyed

Sirrox: "You talk too much, elf. You know nothing of violence and chaos."

ern blinks at this, turning her slow and careful gaze to the minotaur.

Anxious

Fern: "But... why would you want violence and chaos? Would it not be better to live in harmony? We... well, we might not be here in that case."

  

Manfred: "I agree with the bull-man. You all blather like children in the schoolyard."

  

Confident Voice : ”Welcome back! On tonight's programme: Adventurers from all over seek riches and freedom from the Gorehouse! Who will survive? Who will perish? Find out tonight, onnn…”

The crowd yells in unison: Gore-House Gold! Gore-House Gold! Gore-House Gold!

Asra: HEY! What are the riches you are telling us about?

Confident Voice: “Oh... you'll find out soon enough.”

Metal walls shoot out from a gap in the floor, mutilating some of the bodies of the expired adventurers. 3 foot, rusty spikes poke out from the walls and slowly begin to force the adventurers past the cutouts.On both hallways, the adventurers are forced onward.

Jeffram: "Wha-AAAA!"

Rusty, spiked walls pick up speed. From a lazy crawl to a well paced run.

  

The split groups are forced to merge as the hallways do. Split party members are reunited. But for how long?

  

Tim, probably the slowest since he is a Loxodon cries as he's poked in his but by a spike but eventually runs, too.

  

Before the group lies a pit of black, with 4 narrow boards about 80 feet in length reaching to the other side of the pit. The boards are less than a foot wide, supported by thin metal pipes that must reach all the way down the pit.

  

Adresin: “Spikes. If it's not spiked walls, it's spiked pits. I can see all the way down there, and they didn't even bother cleaning out from the last game.”

  
The smell of rancid meat and a cacophony of moving bugs hit the adventurers with sharp senses.

  

The walls are coming.

  

 Sarovnek's size makes it hard to balance himself on such a narrow path.

  

Cyran loses balance, accidentally pushing Sarovnek.

  

They both tumble down, disappearing into the black void without so much as a whisper.

Jeffram: Fern, me lad. Tell me sister...

Fern looks back, catching a glimpse of Jeffram, falling into the pit; no longer able to save his family.

Jeffram: “Lissey......”

  

A careless push, and Enwelel joins the doomed.

Enwelel: “Hobso! Though this body may perish, our memories live on! Don't you f-”

Her voice falls silent.

  

Hobso: “Oh, GODS! No, no, no, nononono this can't be happening, no no, this some fucked up nightmare, oh GODS, no, no, NO!”

  

The spiked walls continue to chase the adventurers as they navigate the 4 narrow paths. A few survivors dropped their weapons to gain better balance. Panic does funny things even to the most acrobatic of persons. In their rush for survival, some of the adventurers did push unfamiliar faces down. Some by accident. Some intentional. No one would openly admits to this. A guilt they will carry for the rest of their short lives.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Hobso: “I will find your shadow!”

  

Dread (excited): “Rejoice! Our lord is pleased! It's only a shame they have died so quickly, as to deny our lord's satisfaction.”

  

Bogs appears quite pleased with himself. He has been keeping a beat on his drum all the while, and has convinced himself that the crowd is as much impressed with his skills as the spectacle of carnage.  
  

Tarlak has kept as much a low profile as he can while hovering above the others. Attracting attention surely cannot end well.  
  

Ella panics as her stout legs betray her. She pushes into the others, slips on a tomato, and faceplants with an enormous THUD.

  

As Ella gets up, her hand slips on the very same tomato she fell on.

Far too close to the pit. She falls a second time, this time to an untimely death.  
  

### 24 survivors remain.

The crowd can't hold back their laughter seeing such a small person slip twice.

  

Confident Voice: “Ha ha! Now that was a keeper! How about a little replay? Gaz?”

  

In the front of the stands was a small goblin with a pointy wizard's hat, sound asleep.

At the sound of his name, he quickly rises, chanting a spell.

An illusion spell blankets over the adventurers in the pit.

  

Ella's party members watch in horror as images of Stoutfoot is made a mockery, slipping on a tomato twice and into the spike pit. The illusion even shows in clear light, how the spikes stab through her eye, neck, chest and abdomen. She writhes in pain, then slumps dead.

  
Confident Voice: “Hahaha! Now THAT'S what I call…”

  
"GORE-HOUSE GOLD!", The crowd answers back.

  
Torches around a door are lit up by the adventurers. With their entry blocked off by a spike wall, There is nowhere else to go.  
  

Confident Voice: “Well, come on, then, brave warriors! Don't be shy.A step forward is a step to your riches!”

  

The group, cautious, afraid, wary, open and enter through their only path forward.

Light fades as they walk on. Their only sight was the crowd overhead.

Instinctively, everyone grabs shoulders. This is a game of death. The last concern is personal space.

  

Confident Voice: “Now, can anyone tell me what's wrong with the show?”

  

The cheers lessen. Everyone begins to question each other and throw suggestions.

Confident Voice: “Oh, come on! You all know this one! Every show we have, there's been plenty of…”

  

A barrage of answers.

"Blood!"

“Gore!"

"Death!"

"Tea Parties!"

  

"Black Magic!"

  

"Not enough Rakdos!"

  

Confident Voice: “No, no, no! If it were a Gruul Raider it would have already bit you in the nose! The one in the back, yes, you're right. Not enough tea parties. I myself could go for an Earl Grey with some milk right now. Remind me after the show, yes? All wrong (except for the tea).”

  

“What we're missing…”

  

The adventurers hear a faint rumble. Another boulder? No. Growling… is constant. Getting louder and louder. The lights return to full strength. Several doors all around the adventurers, in what looks like an arena.

  

The doors all open slowly. Revealing...

Confident Voice

”...Is some dismemberment.”

  

Lions.

  

Tarlak

...what is that sound?

...some sort of... contraption releasing air?

As the lions, starved to a point with their ribs poke out , approach the warriors, a hissing sound.

From the shadows emerges giant snake heads, where the lions' tails should be.

Confident Voice:“A gift from the Simic Combine!”

  

The surviving chimeras from their many experiments.

The chimeras approach the fighters carefully. These creatures are imperfect: some scarred, one with 3 snake heads on its tail.

  

Not that it matters. Danger is danger.

  

The warriors ready their weapons.

  

Ravizaz

Alarmed

snarls Go! I hold them! Me small! Safe!

  

Ravizaz

Ravizaz closes in on the closest Chimera, stabbing at its side while holding onto its mane.

  

The snake head repeatedly bites at the goblin, injecting its own lion body with venom with every miss.

  

Ravizaz

The small one's fury inspires battle.

  

Members of the group attack, while others are too frightened to fight, cowering against the arena walls.

  

They make their way towards the huge doors behind the chimeras.

Tarlak

Nervous

Yes, it is only fitting that you, lesser races protect the only noble Aarakocra here.

  

I'll meet you all past those door. Fight Brave!

Tarlak flies low along the walls. He is the first to enter the 15ft high doors.

  

The chimeras roar in pain as they battle the brave fighters that dare take them on.

  

Shane begins to cast spells to aid the fight. He is momentarily distracted by a spot on his favorite robe.

  

A moment is all it takes. When Shane looks up to battle, a Chimera swipes at him.

  

His jaw flies and hits the arena wall. Shane goes limp as the Chimera feasts on his seizing body.

Sirrox gores one of the Chimeras in the neck, his back covered by Aileen the monk.

  

Dread casts healing magic on anyone who gets bloodied.

  

The tide is turning. The chimeras are injured, blinded, missing their snake heads.

  

Sirrox

We're pushing them back! Just a little more, and the day is ours!

Excited

Yes... survive so that you may suffer! The pain... it is glorious, no!!?!?

1x

  

Dread has one hand on his staff, but the other hand...caresses his abdomen gently.

  

The caressing hand works its way up his body, towards the chest and neck.

Excited

To suffer is to know you are alive! Pain is th-

A severed snake had been crawling along the battlefield to the back of the battle. It's fangs had found its way into Dread's neck.

Dread's limp body swells and seizes as the snake continues to bite his torso.

  

With no other person knowledgeable in healing magic, the fighters slowly succumb to their wounds as the battle draws out.

  

Sybil is the last one past the door. The last thing she sees is Sirrox's body, torn in two as the chimeras fight for his entrails.

### 16 Survivors Remain

  

Pitch black, yet again. But this time, even those with Darkvision can't see. Magical Darkness.

  

As their numbers thin, the adventurers have calmed to a degree. Party members hold hands or shoulders to stay together as they walk on.

  

Confident Voice

“...Folks. I'm very sorry to say. But we've reached the climax of our show.”

  

The crowd boos and throws their concessions at random. Popcorn and various foods hit the party's helmets and armor at random.

  

Confident Voice

“Now, now, as we always do, the Gorehouse saves the best for last.”

  

You see, the fun these adventures have been having was brought to them. They didn't really have an option, either way.”

  
The darkness begins to lift.

  

The remaining survivors seem to have been grouped together with the last member of their former party. Each pair stands in a metal cube with glass walls big enough to accommodate even a loxodon. 8 cubes arranged neatly in an open arena.

  

Over them, an opening. Tall enough for one person to help another to it.

Confident Voice

“But now, they do. A product fit for Rakdos himself; Chaos cubes. Even I don't know what'll happen once we activate them! Mighty Adventurers! We apologize for ending your fun so soon.

We leave you with a gift: Freedom to choose. Who stays? Who goes? Maybe you'll get powers beyond your wildest dreams. Or riches that we couldn't afford to give! Or you can both stay. Fine with us. We'll just throw a tarp over the cube and check back on you in a few months time.

So...

  

Who wants out of the cube?

  

Bogs smiles at Tarlak. Tarlak does not smile back. He's a fucking drummer boy. Tarlak makes a break for it, but Bogs grabs his foot, holding him in place, his eyes turn red as he opens his mouth and flames engulf the entirety of the cube. As the smoke settles, Bogs hand grips at the hole, standing on his tip toes on the corps of Tarlak. Not a single feather remains on what was a magnificent Arakocra.

  

Confident Voice

“Oh, my, RAKDOS what a way to say goodbye! Gaz, lower the cube. This one is fit for the Cult! If he so wishes, of course. The more the merrier here at the Gorehouse. The way he took out that birdman!”

  

Zatov has been silent until now, in awe of the destructive power of this guantlet.

Fascinated

“Take me, I'm one of you, take me into your cult! I'll show you destruction!”

Zatov looks at 'Asifa with contempt and raises his hands and fire envelopes her. 'Asifa crumples to the ground badly burnt but her head rises to face the wizard, her eyes glowing white and her hair flying wildly around her as if charged with electricity. A thunderous boom rattles their cube as 'Asifa rises into the air and out if it. Leaving Zatov with nothing but his own screams and curses.  
  

Clay

“Clay looks at Dale and smiles, saying "Thank you for your sacrifice. Through it know that the One True Being will carry on. That there will be consequences."  
  
Dale  
"W-What do you mean Sacri-"

Clay quickly pulls his sword back and rams it through Dale's open mouth. Clay turns and looks up at the crowd, shaking the blood off his sword.

  

Manfred and Tranquil Pond observe each other for a long moment.

Detached  
  

Manfred: "You are young. Go. I will not stop you."

  
Confused

Tranquil Pond: "What?"

  
Annoyed

Manfred: "Are you fucking deaf? I said go. The library can do without one more crotchety old fool!" The old man laces his hands together and braces himself. The tabaxi pauses.

  
Remorseful

Tranquil Pond: "... Thank you. And I am sorry."

  
Annoyed

Manfred. "Don't be sorry. Be quick. And live."

  
Wordlessly, Tranquil Pond puts his hind foot in the gnome's hand and levers himself up over the side of the cube. As he falls to the ground he turns around to meet the eyes of the wizard, ensuring Manfred knows he is not alone at the moment of his death.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Hobdo turns to Sybil with a wry smile. "so, looks like it is just us left". He tries to quickly stab Sybil with his dagger. She manages to dodge away at the last moment, avoiding a fatal wound. Sybil's eyes glow red and Hobso is suddenly engulfed in white flames. He screams and falls to the ground. "I never trusted you, you greedy halfling,. Good riddance."  
  

Asra gives Vesra a suggestive wink as he helps her out pushing her to the top with his shield.

  
Playful

Asra: I may see where my luck puts me. See you later outside

  

Serious

  

Vesra: Thank you stranger. I won't forget you and will avenge the others! Take this talisman.

As she tries to hand him a little wooden doll of a shielded soldier, she gets Asra's rusty rapier in  
Return.  
  

Nervous

“Hold it for me for a while.

  

Vesra climbs out of the cube. Asra shoots her a confident smile, holding the doll to his chest.

  

Jorna (Alarmed)  
“Hey! What the fuck!? This cube is closed tight. We can't get out!”

Jorna violent shaked the glass cube left and right, to no avail. The opening is closed right by a metal hatch. The Gnome and Dwarf seem trapped.

  

Confident Voice

“Hmmmmm....

...too bad. Not my problem.”

  
  
  

And tHAT'S A WRAP, FOLKS! JOIN US NEXT TIME FOR ANOTHER EPISODE OF...

  
"GOREHOUSE GOLD!"

  

The crowd lazily cheers as victory music begins to play.  
  

Confident Voice

Gaz? Hit it!

  

The little goblin runs over to a switch nearby. With a flick, the cubes begin to light different colors and shake violently.

  
Jorna: “You son of a whore!! Fuck you, fuck all of you! I should have never p-”

An explosion goes off inside the cube. Glass shards rain in all directions, cutting the tent fabric overhead and injuring some viewers.

  

Sybil Shadowblight: “The mouth on that one…”

  

The surviving party take cover behind the yet activated cubes. Ray's of light shoot down from the cut canvas ceiling about 80ft high. Manfred watches Tranquil with a smile. His cube glows a deep blue...and suddenly he's motionless. Still like a statue.

A closer inspection. His eyes are moving so slowly. that it takes a full minute for him to blink. Trapped in a slowed time spell.He must be seeing everything outside the box in blinding speed.

The other cubes with smouldering corpses don't activate.

  
Confident Voice (Confused)

“Huh. Will you look at that.”

  

“We may have to make bigger cubes for bigger events...

Well! No matter! Survivors? Your gold.”

  

“Good day, folks! Be safe! And remember to love each other.”

...Ha! Kidding! Love Rakdos!

...or else.

  

The crowd begins to shuffle off, leaving their half finished meals.Gaz the Goblin has a bag the size of his body.

  

With all his might, he rapidly throws currency over the party. A mixture of gold, silver and copper.As the party collects their meager gold, a figure steps forth.

  

Dressed in a black suit and red tie, the handsome demon brushes back his black hair. Human in appearance, save for the small horns from his forehead and... enchanting... beautiful eyes... and that charming smile...

  

An Incubus.

  

### 8 Survivors remain.

Bogs - Dragonborn
Garreth - Monk
Pond - Leonin/Tabaxi
Vesra - Tiefling Boros
Sybil -



  

## Chapter 2: The Ringmaster’s Gifts

  
Sybil Shadowblight

Men rarely interest you. But this one... he's dangerous. In every way of the word. You can imagine being intimate with him, having a family, growing old as he retains his demonic youth.

Your eyes meet for a moment. He's the one. You're sure of it. The most sure you've been all your life. You've never felt this about anything before.

  

Confident Voice

“...Ansem's the name. The spokesperson from earlier.

A promise is a promise. This gold will never be enough to cover the death of your... friends? Companions? The real treasure is me. Haha,  well... My capacity to grant small wishes.”  
  
“Ahh.... Earl Grey. A splash of milk, of course.

Well, come on now, take a seat with me. Tell me your stories. I assume you're all strangers? Consider this a meet and greet. How else am I to grant your wishes if I know nothing of how it could help?”

  

Sybil Shadowblight

You take the seat immediately next to Ansem. As he smiles at you, you can feel a heat in your cheeks. Were you always this easy to impress? Oh, it doesn't matter.

Sybil steps forward, she is exceptionally beautiful, with flaming red hair worn in intricate braids, pale skin and narrow gray eyes, her pupils glow a soft red. She is of average height for a female human, but has a foreign accent you can't quite place. When sybil gets angry or excited, a small, harmless, nonmagical flames surrounds her, a "gift" from her patron.

Excited
Sybil: “Well hello there Ansem…”

Ansem: “Charmed. Truly.”

Bogs Hothands
Bogs is visibly annoyed (rolls eyes)

Sybil Shadowblight
Brooding

said with an accent My story is my own.... I come from a place far from here. My whole town was destroyed. I am searching for those responsible....

'Asifa

For a moment you become obsessed with this man's presentation. You see potential in him. A raiding partner for life.

But you snap out of it. This is a trick. He is a lowly demon, worthy only of a blade in his throat for killing your party.


Ansem
Curious
And what destroyed your town?

  

Sybil Shadowblight
Disgusted
I was but a baby... I do not know for sure. But it speaks to me on occasion..

Bogs Hothands
Bogs passes his hand over his mouth in a quick nonchalant fashion, mumbling something under his breath.

  
Ansem
“Hmmm..... not enough to go on, I'm afraid.”  

Bogs Hothands

A wretched smell of rotten eggs permeates seemingly from Ansem. - Prestidigitation

  
Ansem

Ansem sniffs air. His irises flash an orange-red hue as he stares at Bogs with a serious expression. The smell of rotten eggs doesn't linger for long as Ansem's eyes flash again, replacing the smell to Emanate from Bogs.  
  

Ansem looks disappointed.
“A child among us, I see. I offer you a small wish, and you disrespect me?

You may leave.”

  
One of the cafe seats offered by Ansem disappears in black smoke.
  
Ansem: “Do continue, red haired maiden.”  
  
Sybil Shadowblight“So what sort of wish can you can't my dear? I notice your eyes Ansem,. They are similar to mine. Are you cursed as I am?”

  
Ansem

“I can't reverse time, nor bring back the dead. But I can summon items of great magic. I can summon creatures to protect you for a time. Depending on the strength you ask for. It can be strong temporarily, or a bit of a boost, permanently.

Sybil Shadowblight

Anxious

“...Can you summon the thing that killed my family?”

Ansem

“Oh, no, dear. I was born this way. A Product of Rakdos himself...summoning a creature I know almost nothing about... I cannot. I would have to know more.”  
  

Sybil Shadowblight
Affectionate

“I wish I knew more.... Then perhaps you can give me something to aid me in my quest.”

  
Ansem 
*looks at Bogs

“...are you still here?”

He flicks his wrist again. About 50ft away by the stairs leading to the stalls, a small wooden chair materializes.

  
Ansem’s tone is one of Disappointment.
“I return the respect you have shown me.
Go.”

  

Kind

“...seeking something that has ruined your life... yes, I believe I can give you this…”

His eyes flash again, a brighter shade of golden yellow. Concentrating at his hands, he creates black smoke, with occasional flashes of yellow like a blacksmith's hammer on hot steel.

  

The smoke lifts. In Ansem's hand, a ring. The inset jewel changes color. A vibrant blue, to an ominous purple.

He places it onto Sybil's ring finger. Her hand inches to his face as he looks her in the eyes.

  
Ansem
Affectionate
“This ring will warn you of intent of whomever you touch, be it beast or person; demon or 
celestial.”

  
Sybil Shadowblight
As his hands caress away from yours, the ring shines a lovely pink hue.

Affectionate

“Wonderful my dear. I thank you.”

  
[Ring of Insight Obtained]
With this ring, you succeed in Insight Checks so long as you touch the target.

Ansem
“Anyone else?”

Bogs Hothands

Bogs stands up, swinging a small hand drum to his front, and his shield/drum around his back. As he strolls away slowly, he taps a gentle and enchanting rhythm.

  
Bogs Hothands
Disgusted
“He's all yours, compatriots. Don't trust his venomous words.”

  

Clay
Folds his arms, looking at Ansem. Then sits in the proffered chair.

Curious

“I'm not sure what you can offer me, fleeting gifts are but that, fleeting and as such not of much use to one such as I!”

  

Ansem

Ansem mirrors your body language.

Amused

“Oh? No gifts then? No gift fit for the one true being?”

  

Clay

Confident

“I didn't say that, I just wondered you limitations. What gift could you offer that is qualified for the One.”

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs continues his subtle tune from across the room, adding sparse notes from his pan flute. Though sad, the melody reminds some of their childhoods, innocent and care-free

  
Bogs Hothands 1d20 (17) (+5) = 22 Performance

  

Sybil Shadowblight

“Darling Ansem. If none of these brutes want your gifts I will gladly enjoy them.”

  
Garreth

Serious

“This world is rife with distraction and frivolity, but I sense these gifts you speak of are more than just ornaments.” Garreth, who has been stoic and contemplative in his silence, deftly appears by one of the cafe seats.

  

“I seek a greater understanding of diving order. The irony of my presence here, a place of chaos and irreverence, is not lost on me. But that is just another facade; there is always deeper meaning. Ansem, what have you to offer a man who has dedicated his life to seeing natural order and light in even the darkest, most volatile places?”

  

'Asifa

Brooding

“I know not of deeper meaning. I would settle for any meaning. If you would aid me in using my power to its fullest or understanding its source, my ears are open.”

  

Garreth

Curious

 to 'Asifa

“are you also on a path to enlightenment? Locating a power's source is surely just another search for deeper meaning, no? You seek to understand the truth within yourself.

  

'Asifa

'Asifa's gray eyes narrow as they asses Garrett.

Amused

“Careful, wise one. You go too deep and you might well drown.”

  

Ansem

Ansem stirs his cup, thinking of what to give.

Amused

“For you, one true being.”

  

It's a normal hand mirror. Turning it back and forth, looking through it. Nothing special.

You look into the mirror.

  

It's you. In all your perfection. You flash yourself a smile.

  

You turn the mirror at an angle to look at your new companions... to see that they don't appear in the mirror.

  

Ansem

Amused

“And you, white haired one. I've lived many centuries. And I believe I know what you seek.”

Again, black smoke. Ansem produces a key, with a long strip of leather. He gives it to Asifa.

  

'Asifa

The moment you take the key's string, the key tugs away, aiming to a direction left of you.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Angry

“Is there any deeper meaning then power and revenge?”

  

'Asifa

No matter how you hold the key, it points to that one direction. When you drop it to the floor, it lays limp.

  

Around your neck, it stays still. Only in your hand does it point you...somewhere.

  
Ansem

Amused

“For you, monk. Something that you may carry with you...forever.”

  

Garreth

Curious

“Forever? Or simply as long as I live to carry it?”

Gently he takes your face and stares deep into your eyes. The flash repeatedly that same golden yellow.

  

Your eyes feel like they're melting in the heat of his stare. You let out a cry of pain.

  
Garreth

Panicked

YYAAAAAAAAAAA

  

He lets you go. Your eyes seared in pain. Then suddenly, gone. You're fine.

  

Garreth

You look around. Your vision is the same. No changes, it seems.

  

Ansem

Playful

“...who else?”

  

Tranquil Pond

Blue eyes darting between the other survivors and the demon, Tranquil Pond advances hesitantly.

Doubtful

I suppose I... am next.

  
Sybil Shadowblight

Affectionate

Isn't Ansem the best with all his little treasures.

  

Bogs Hothands

Despite feeling that he performed that song better than he can remember, nobody seemed to notice. Bogs realizes he has no chance of competing with a magical charmer who bares gifts aplenty.

  

Bogs Hothands

Sarcastic

Are you all done groveling? Why don't you kiss his feet for murdering your friends for sport?

  

Tranquil Pond

The tabaxi turns his head to look at the dragonborn calmly.

Detached

“Do you too wish to die? We are not yet free.”

  

Ansem

Confident

“For you, my furry friend it seems I've nothing for you, yet. So,for now, A calling card. Until you need my services.”  
  

Tranquil Pond

No smoke, this time, merely a sleight of hand trick. He produces a paper card bearing the name "Ansem", in neat cursive.

Ansem

Confident

Burn it when you need guidance.

  
Tranquil Pond

Annoyed

What? But do you know who I...

Pond licks a finger and runs it across his whiskers.

Detached

“Very well. I have no need of such material possessions in any event.”

He walks a short distance away from the rest of the group and continues grooming.

  
Ansem

“And for the barbarian;”

He moves his mouth as his eyes glow yellow. But no sound.  
  

Vesra

You hear not just Ansem's whispers... but many more. 5, 7 different voices whispering. They grow louder, louder, seeming to come from every direction.

...then nothing. Back to the silence of the gorehouse.

  

Ansem claps his hands.

“Very well. You've all received your gifts for attendance.”  
  

Vesra

Despite Ansem being generous to the other survivors yet, Vesra is still worried about being tricked. However, his attractiveness keeps her from attacking the Incubus.

  
Thick black smoke begins to envelop the area, swirling about violently.

Ansem:“Do drop by again soon.”  
Vesra: Wait! Don't go! What was that?

  

The smoke clears. The cafe setting, the stage equipment, Gaz the Goblin: all gone.

What remains is the popcorn from earlier, and a bright beam of sunshine shooting from the exit atop the stairs.

  

With nowhere else to go, the group leave through the exit.

  

## Chapter 3: We Survived.

  

They now face the metropolis of Ravnica: the Tenth District. With its many inhabitants, skyscrapers and shops all around.

The group turns in, facing each other.

Sybil Shadowblight

24th Sep 2019

Upon breathing fresh air, you remember your shameless attraction to the Incubus.

  

How dare you be charmed by a demon who murdered your friends?

  

Enwelel, Jarda, Aillen...

  

The trauma of this day will not be forgotten soon. If not your former friends, it could have easily been you.

  

Seems you have become bonded to these strangers in an unfortunate way.

  

For now, you have your freedom to do as you wish.

'Asifa

  

'Asifa grips the key, a look of determination on her face. What of this lot? Could they be of any use?

Vesra

Serious

  

We need to stop this, so it never happens ever again!

Tranquil Pond

  

Tranquil Pond leans forward, inspecting Vesra with interest.

Curious

Oh, yes? And what would you do as your first act to stop a group capable of detaining fifty adventurers and slaughtering them creatively?

Clay

  

This must be reported, this event clearly violated multiple laws, ordinances, and Senate regulations.

'Asifa

  

'Asifa is a young woman with long white hair and skin of shades of blue or grey depending on the light. Whatever the color of her skin, it is graced by patterns in the shape of arcing lightening. Bright gray eyes look out from her attractive face. She was raised by a kind elderly couple. She is well armored and lightly armed.

Vesra

Angry

  

Oh, the Boros legion will be more than happy to burn down a place like this!

Sybil Shadowblight

  

Syb shakes her head, disgusted she was attracted to that foul being...

Tranquil Pond

  

Standing just over six feet tall, Tranquil Pond has the lanky yet graceful form of his race. His blue eyes are inquisitive, and his nose and ears are large, betraying his high blood, which any tabaxi would know. His short fur is dark chocolate-brown around the face and ears, fading to a lighter shade of brown along his neck and body. He wears a long, open vest in a blue that matches his eyes and loose grey trousers that tighten around his upper calf. His dark brown hands and paw-like feet are bare, and his dark brown tail swishes disconsolately.

Sybil Shadowblight

  

You are an interesting one talking cat. I've not seen your kind before.

Vesra

  

Vesra's twin-ended tail twitches violently out of anger. Her skin is mostly alabaster white and scaled. Only her back is black which fades into her limps,

tail and bat-like wings. her face is dominated by angry eyes, so her small horns barely get any notice. While her clothes are nothing special, she carries a huge amount of sharp weapons with her, so that her newest addition, the rusty rapier, feels a warm welcome between them. Some self made carvings and dolls, mostly avian or aquatic, decorate he belongings.

  

Pond's eyes squint into a feline smile at Sybil.

 to Sybil Shadowblight

Proud

I can hardly call myself a model example of my kind, madam.

 to Vesra

Doubtful

Place? I fear, even should they believe our story, (gesturing around) they will find little to burn.

He brings a shaky paw to his face, fingers running compulsively along his whiskers in agitation.

Vesra

  

Do you just want them to run their insane games freely? You just survival by pure luck!

Tranquil Pond

  

The catlike man ceases grooming for a moment and fixes Vesra with a piercing, almost imperious, stare.

Serious

No. I survived due to the workings of the universe, and due to the sacrifice of a comrade.

Sybil Shadowblight

Detached

We all survived for a reason. I survived due to being better than my competition.

  

Tranquil Pond

He resumes his ritual and adopts an air of calm, though the paw still quivers minutely.

Sybil Shadowblight looks amusedly to Tranquil Pond

“Well you are a curious one.”

Angry

Now. That blasted Ansem needs to be dealt with though!

Clay

  

Stands several inches over six feet. Looking around the room glaring at the mess that has been left behind.

Sybil Shadowblight

  

A small fire begins to cover Sybil's entire form.

Clay

Yes, he must be brought to justice.

  

Pond's head swivels between them.

  

Clay

The proper laws must be followed! Not only is he guilty of 40 counts of kidnapping, 33 counts of murder or attempted murder, but also unlicensed food preparation. Lack of proper event registration, and many many counts of littering!

  

Tranquil Pond

Well, it appears you are all determined. So be it; I will accompany you as well. This should be an... enlightening... experience.

Sybil Shadowblight

Laws? We can deal with him outside the law! Swift revenge

Sybil Shadowblight looks around for any symbols or markings on the building she might recognize.

  

Clay

I see countless building code violations, sanitation violations, was this event venue not even INSPECTED!!!

  

Garreth

The letter of the law is a mere distraction. What happens defied all natural laws - the basest covenants between beings that preserve the circle of life as we know it. That we survived now binds us together. Like the earliest tribes of sentient races, we must forge our own Oasis of light in the face of that dark, unholy wilderness.

  

Bogs Hothands stands nearly 7 feet tall, though he would say so. His rusty scales resemble a tarnished set of armor. His eyes grey, turn red with anger, which you witnessed recently. His posture implies that he couldn't care less of the carnage of the day, although you suspect a soft interior to the facade. His muscular body is adorned with instruments for every occasion. The rapier and dagger which dangle on either side of his waist, seem lightly used. In stark contrast, his metal shield, or drum, that you heard ringing throughout the arena, appears to have been drug amidst a convoy of elephants for the last 20 years.

  

Bogs Hothands

Well said Mr... My name is Bogs Hothands. May I ask yours?

Detached

I wonder if there are any good taverns around here. Not for the ale. I need new recruits. A talented singer perhaps...

  

'Asifa

Well aren't you lot impressive. Love the righteous anger and the seething hatred, they look good on you.

Doubtful

I do agree, a horrid thing that was back there, I hate to see people pushed around and used for entertainment. But really, where would we even start to stop it? And where would it end but in our early demise. We barely got out of there this last time.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

You have no idea what I've been through to warrant my hatred.

  

Clay

The rule of law does more than ensure freedom from high-handed action by rulers. It ensures justice between man and man however humble the one and however powerful the other. A man with five coppers can call to account the guild with five billion platinum in assets-and the two will be heard as equals before the law.

  

The law must come first, all other worries are secondary. For it to be otherwise invites chaos, disorder, and death.

Each and every violation must be catalogued, detailed, and reported. To do otherwise would allow this ... guild.. to have committed an atrocity and not be punished. To allow a citizen to be punished and not receive justice!

Bogs Hothands

Oh, do either of you have any talents? The Viol, flute, or can you carry a tune at the very least?

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Unfortunately my talents lie outside of the musical realm

  

Vesra

Clay is right! The fist of justice must strike them. If not by law, then by force!

Bogs distracts the Tiefling from her anger but she answers him.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

I am all for justice, but dealt by our own hands.

  

Clay

Only if said justice has been properly adjudicated by the courts.

  

Vesra

... I am not that good with music either, but I craft talisman and lucky charms in my free time. (she shows him a sea servant she recently made.)

  

Bogs Hothands

Hmm. Yea, it's pretty. What is it for again? Luck, you say?

  

Tranquil Pond

I have had training in the lyre, Master Hothands. However I find myself lacking an instrument.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Why are we speaking of music? There are more important issues at hand!

  

Bogs Hothands

How about some introductions all around? Surely I'm not the only one grasping for formalities.

Have you ever played a Viol? I've a spare one right here. What could be more important than forming a lasting bond among like fated folk, through the power of music?

Sybil Shadowblight

  

Formally, my name is Sybil Shadowblight. I am hunting a truly evil being who murdered my family and is still haunting me.

  
  

The leonin half-bends into the beginnings of an elegant leg, before his ears twitch briefly and he straightens again. He makes a much simpler bow from the waist, arms at his sides.

  

Bogs Hothands

Pleased to meet you, and let me assure you that I did try and try to help free you of your charm, without sticking my neck out too far, if you know what I mean.

  

Tranquil Pond

I have forsaken my name, and seek the path to become as a Tranquil Pond, approaching the world with openness and serenity.

  

Clay

The large man stops cataloging building code violations, and pulls out sheets of paper.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

I do recognize that you tried to help now And I am ashamed that horrid thing charmed me.

  

Clay

Handing the pamphlets out I am Clay. Bringer of Truth. Embodiment of Law. The One. Currently Officer 42.a.r.1z of the Azorius Senate.

  

I am the only true being, whose word embodies the value of Law. If you'd like to know more, we meet at several halls throughout Ravenica every Azorsday. Cookies and Drinks are provided to all who seek the One. Newsletter is delivered every second Matsday. Come join us and seek the One. We have cake.

  

Pond raises a paw, closing his eyes in a half-smile.

I fear I have given up the desires of the worldly. However we are well met, Clay. I look forward to testing my training with you.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

I will take your cookies, but you can keep your laws.

  

Clay

Put your trust in Clay, it will be rewarded. For in Clay we trust.

For Clay can be trusted, Clay has no Evil. For Clay bakes.

  

Tranquil Pond

Does Clay bake in a kiln?

  
  

Sybil looks over the city view from the Gorehouse, and spots a sign all too familiar.

  

Along Tin Street, there is a wooden sign in the shape of a flagon of ale, with the word 'Beau's' underneath it.

  

You've all heard good things about this place.

Sybil Shadowblight

  

Let's bring this gathering to Beau's, shall we?

Tranquil Pond

Pond extends his arm in a lead-the-way gesture.

Clay

No Clay bakes in an oven, each Cookie and Cake is inspected three times to make sure that they are uniform and even baked. It is the only way to be sure.

Bogs Hothands

Excited

Did you say ale? A tavern, with music, women, gambling, where's the lucky talisman thing?

Bogs Hothands

Borg rushes to the front, beside Mr. Pond, and starts a cadence on his metal drum, encouraging everyone to "march" in time.

The Gore house lies in Precinct Six, where the everyman works the docks and factories for a living wage.

  

Past the Gore house and of the Boros Legion's headquarters lies Tin Street; a place where many can find just about everything.

  

Traversing their way through the crowd of elves, minotaur, goblins and loxodons, the group find themselves inside Beau's.

Bogs Hothands

Passionate

This is no ordinary cadence see, there's magic in this fugly cauldron.

  

Sybil holds the door handle, and looks back to the group. Never did she think that she would head to an alehouse mere hours after watching her party fall, one by one.

  

She takes a deep breathe, and heads in with her new acquaintances.

Chapter 2

Introductions

Clay “I've heard good things. Apparently the cook bakes her own bread. Obviously this means the food is trustworthy.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Baked in the oven like clay?

  

Clay is confused. “Why yes, I assume so? But as a Baker,while she may be a lawbreaker, she can't be evil. So the food should be acceptable.”

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond's gaze slides away from Clay as he briefly meets the eyes of Sybil and Bogs, his expression sarcastic in its blandness.

  

Amused

No, of course you are right, Master Clay. No maker of breads could possibly have any evil intent.

  

Sybil Shadowblight is amused. “No of course not.....Not with all the laws of chemistry they must follow.”

  

Clay “Exactly, an Evil Baker... who has ever heard of such a thing. It's preposterous. They're far too busy to be Evil. Why do they need to awaken in the middle of the night to start heating the ovens? Then to proof the dough, let alone bake the loaves. Plus she still needs to cook the evening meals. As I said, far too busy to be Evil.”

  
  

Pond brings his face close to Clay's as his blue eyes scrutinise the man. “Do you know, I can almost hear the capital E. You intrigue me.”

'Asifa “You're all pretty entertaining, I'll give you that.” 'Asifa waves over the bartender for a drink. “To tell you the truth, the members of my old band were getting under my skin. All they cared about was gold, gold, gold. I mean sure, I don't want to be poor but jeez, all the money grubbing gets old after a while. Only that damn wizard Zatov had his heart set on anything else. And what was he always after? Destruction!”

  

“Have you ever tried to be friends with someone who only wanted to destroy you in the end? I mean sure, I don't mind frying somebody's brains out if I really need to but jeez, I'll leave it at that. I don't need to leave him in ashes.”

  

“Hey there, pour me something strong will you? Thanks.”

  

Tranquil Pond

Detached

Only a cup of water for me, please. The Tabaxi looks to her. “I cannot say my companions wished me dead. Though, I understand your distaste for the treasure-hunting aspect. I myself have given up worldly possessions.”

  

Bogs Hothands says to the group, “Not that I need liquid courage, but I do enjoy a good brew. Bartender! Give me one of the brews you are testing out in the back room. You know the one I'm speaking of.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Something stronger for me. What sorts of spirits do you have?

Tranquil Pond Pond's eyes dart to Clay briefly and he squints a little in a grin at Sybil as he raises his paws and wags his fingers.

“Eeeevil spirits.”

Sybil Shadowblight is baffled “Sorry,. Common is not my first language, did I say something incorrect?”

Bogs Hothands “Haha good one chap. She was speaking of ale.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond chuckles a little at his own joke.

 to Sybil Shadowblight

Amused

Ahem. No, you did nothing of the sort. I was merely using the homonyms of 'spirits' for liquor and 'spirits' for ghosts to make a little jape. You will forgive me.

Sybil Shadowblight

Amused

  

Ahh yes! Now I get it. Well I like to destroy both kinds of spirits.

Yes. Like ale, but smaller and stronger. Made for not children.

Clay

  

Motions to a server

Excited

Would you still happen to have any pastries left, if. It I would love to try one of your delectable baked goods.

Pressing

Now, pulling a flask and drinking from it, when did they start selling Evil Liquors here.

Bogs Hothands

Confused

  

Are you implying that all liqueurs are evil, or are you referring to Sybil's possessed, spirited spirits?

Clay

Pressing

  

I am referring to Tranquil Pond 's allegations

Vesra

Passionate

  

I order of that evil spirit! Better destroy it by drinking!

Serious

You can't be careful enough around spirits!

Sybil Shadowblight

Angry

  

 to Vesra

this I know all to well...

Sybil's skin begins to emit a soft harmless flame and her eyes turn bright glowing red.

Vesra

Worried

  

You seem already possessed by them! Be careful and I will help you to get you free!

Sybil Shadowblight

Remorseful

  

That is my burden.... To vanquish this.. spirit that possess me. He has done terrible things and made me do even more terrible things. I have it under control for the most part, but his power seaps through sometimes He needs to pay for his crimes and...... mine. I will pay for mine when I have avenged my family

Vesra

  

Vesra's tail lashes in acknowledgement.

Sybil Shadowblight

  

Sybil downs her glass and the flames dissipate.

'Asifa

  

'Asifa looks at Sybil with what might be a brief expression of admiration. Then looks away and motions for another drink.

Clay

  

Pulls a small journal and starts writing in it

Sybil Shadowblight

Mocking

What are you writing? Infractions?

  

After downing his thick and heady stout, Bogs Hothands motions for to Mr. Pond to follow.

Confident

“Ready to blow the roof off this joint?”

Bogs continues toward a vacant area of the tavern, sets a stool up, and starts to dismantle his instruments one by one...

Passionate

in a booming voice I know most of you haven't seen me perform. I go by Bogs Hothands, and I'm going to play you all a few tunes that you've never heard before, because I wrote them of course. The first one is called, "On the trail, to a new life, I ride."

He arrange his metal drum on the floor, hand drum in lap, pan flute high on his chest, viol and lute on either side of him, in a quick manner. Then clears his throat...

The tune starts with an upbeat "floor drum" mixed in with accents on the hand drum, and strumming the Viol at each cord change...

Passionate

I haven't a got a friend who knows who I really am. They poke and prod and scar me, because they know they can..

I'm leaving at first light before the realize I lied. On the trail, to a new life.... I ride!"

Bogs continues his ironically sad, but upbeat raucous performance.

  

Afterwards, Bogs kicks his metal drum over and motions to the patrons that he accepts tips.

  

'Asifa applauds Bogs and tries to get the crowd going. “Hey let's give it up for the big guy!” She throws a single gold coin into his drum.

Sybil Shadowblight Syb claps and downs another drink.

'Asifa appears embarrassed. “Don't be cheap now, a musician's got to eat! Let's show our appreciation for an original performance!”

  

The bar is of decent size, and nicely decorated. The 6 or so tables are a dark mahogany, its rough texture accented with a smooth layer of varnish.

  

The patrons are in good spirits, conversing and laughing with one another.

Strange looks were given to the group. It's not everyday you see someone akin to a dragon.

In a world where dragons are extinct.

  
  

Tranquil Pond waves Bogs up to the performance area and continues nursing his water. He grins at Clay, eyes almost fully closing.

  

Small whispers all around.

“Hey, this guy's pretty good. I'll throw something in.” "A beautiful human with skin alight with fire?"

  

"A cross between a man and a lion? A Combine soldier for sure. "

  
  

These descriptors were the stuff of myths and legends.

Tranquil Pond looks to Clay. “Relax, my friend, it was merely a joke, as I said.”

  

A man walks from behind the bar, with a tray full of ale mugs and a small dish of julienned potato crisps.

Beau : “You lot've been garnerin' a bit 'uv attention. New ‘ter these parts?”

Standing an inch taller than the girls, the man has a dark complexion, cheerful green eyes and a kind face. Long, tussled dirty blonde hair covers his head.

  

He's a cheerful accent to go with his disposition.

Beau “This place pulls in a variety of people. Simic Scientists and soldiers, I presume?”

Sybil Shadowblight “I am new to these parts, yes. Not sure about my colleagues here as we were just getting acquainted. Tell me… what do you know about the GoreHouse?”

Beau “Oh, the Rakdos place? It's fun every once in a while. Went there with a few friends for their comedy shows. Hehe… good times.”

Sybil Shadowblight becomes upset. “And what took place in these comedy shows?!”

Beau

“Hmmm, no, it was a regular bit. Stand up comedy. A microphone, a few comedians, ales in hand.” 

“My favorite comedian's the Golgari one. "Seems there's a fungus among us?" Haha oh, man, that guy's good.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight “Interesting. Do you know of any more violent shows?”

Beau’s got a spring in his voice. “The Rakdos Cult are decent people. They work menial jobs in the Tenth. Dishwashers, construction workers, the like.” They hold the best carnivals and shows, and I mean it. The best, compared to the other guilds.”

  

“Mmm...er, well, I have heard of a few events going astray. Demon summoning, sacrificial rites. But they rarely happen, if at all...at least to my knowledge.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight “And what is done about them when they do happen?”

Tranquil Pond “And the... name... of the establishment did not raise any flags?”

  

Beau is baffled. “We all thought it was just an odd nickname for a slaughterhouse. Radkos also tend to some of our cows, you see.”

  

“I'm sure it were all just accidents. The Rakdos members I've met are good, entertainin' folks. Jeff has been our dishwasher for years and he does an amazing job at it. A model employee, I've never had a single problem with him. Isn't that right, Jeff?”

  

From the bar backdoor, a man pops his head out from the side.

'Jeff' is a human with an incredible amount of facial piercings and modifications.

Artificial horns implanted underneath his forehead, poorly colored and uneven red sclera (the whites of one's eyes) and metal holes through his cheeks that display his sharpened canines.

Jeff “Whatever you say, Boss!” He smiles at the party. A line of drool leaks from his cheek holes.

Beau “Ya see? He's all heart. Excuse me a moment.” He sets down his beverages at a table full of patrons. “Now. What else cannea get 'ye?”

  

Tranquil Pond says nothing, waving away the man without a look in his direction.

Clay looks up from his notebook. “Baked goods, specifically pastries or hot rolls.”

Sybil Shadowblight glances to look at Clay's notebook. He's written volumes about what is going on around you. Including:

The number of chairs facing east.

A log of how many seconds in between sips of his drink for a particular obese patron at the bar.

A running tally of potential safety violations for another restaurant across the way.

The color of socks for each party member.

And yes, notes to fill form 3520.A.2 to report a new malicious force in the area. Evil Liquors...

Sybil Shadowblight “Interesting book you have there…”

  

Pond's ears perk up at this comment.

“Oh yes? What does it... Ahem.” A sudden look of disinterest. “Withdrawn. Such worldly attachments are beyond me.”

Sybil Shadowblight “But it's so interesting what he has in there!”

Tranquil Pond “Indeed? Master Clay, would you care to share your writings?”

Clay rotates the book towards Sybil Shadowblight and Tranquil Pond. “Of course.”

Pond leans forward to absorb the notes. With a feline smile he returns to his original relaxed posture. “You entertain me, zealous man.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight “So meticulous…” Within the book, Clay details the happenings of each day. Starting with when he wakes up, the length of time to complete and mass of his morning defecation. The time of his breakfast. [Looking back several days you notice it is always water, a grapefruit, and a slice of toasted day old bread] on days where he leads his prayer circles, the quantity and types of baked goods he makes - then how well they were consumed.

Everything is time stamped, his initials signed.

  

During the day while on duty he notes every person he comes into contact with, what charges could be applied, whether they bake, whether their shirt has buttons and if so the quantity, shape, and color.

  

He provides sketches of locations with apparently random pieces of furniture circled with numbers and letters attached to them.

  

Currently you can see he has detailed everyone within the restaurant, Beau 's hair style detailed almost strand by strand, and then your ask of him

  

Tranquil Pond “For your records... I do not bake.

Clay quickly flips to the back of the book, and scans forward several pages. You see him locate a page with your name as the title where he checks an indication on your lack of baking. Writes a number in a far right column and then dates and initials. Before flipping back to the current page.

  

Sybil Shadowblight “What do you have about me in there?”

  

Clay flips the book to Sybil Shadowblight you move to the end of the book and start driving to your page(s).

  

It details the color of your outfit, as well as what materials make it up. That you are not local to this part of Ravnica. That you are hunting a being that has committed several acts of murder. Notes to follow up to find out the case number for the attacks. Next suggestions that you do not appreciate "comedy shows" with a follow up comment to ask someone at the local senate office what "comedy" is.

  

Finally he has indicated that you are quite flammable and have an unwarranted disregard for the value of the LAW.

  

You do notice a set of questions with blank lines near each of them. One of which is the aforementioned question on baking.

  

Sybil Shadowblight “Hmmm. All accurate. I'm impressed… and no I do not bake”

Garreth

“Detailed observations, Sir Clay. A true mark of discipline, if (perhaps) a lack of focus.

That begs the question - what do you do with it all?”

Clay “When the book is complete, I tag each page and record these in an index. It is then filed. At the end of the year, they are duplicated and each copy I have placed in separate storage locations. Otherwise I rely on them for trials and investigations.”

  

Tranquil Pond “And do you act as judge, jury, or executioner?”

Garreth

“Do you study them, though? Search them for patterns? Observation without understanding seems a waste of time.... And paper… A man with Sir Clay's wealth of knowledge may - and should - serve as all three.”

  

Tranquil Pond

“That, my friend, I do not dispute. However I ask which role, if any, our devout companion plays. And as you yourself said, knowledge and understanding are unequal.”

  

The party enjoys each other's company; laughing, talking, and sharing information with each other. Plans are made to report the events that transpired in the Gorehouse.

Soon the sun begins to set, prompting everyone to return home. The city isn't so safe in the dark corners of night.

  

The 7 nod to each other before departing to their respective homes. 

As each member walks home, they think the same thing; This is not the last time I'll be seeing them.

  

## Chapter 3.5 What is a Home?

The Party finds themselves in front of Beau's again.

Garreth

Garreth has a modest home built on one of the higher terraces of Dravhoc. It is rather light on creature comforts, and certainly has not seen many houseguests since Garreth took residence. His bedroom is quite literal - a room with a bed (meticulously made, of course) and aught else. The kitchen contains the barest of essentials, supplemented by a modest garden just outside. The only remarkable part of the house is his extensive study. Here, Garreth has accumulated texts dating well before the Guidpact on an impressive range of topics: philosophy, law (of course), anthropology, natural history, alchemy. He spends the bulk of his time in this room, researching systems of order ancient and contemporary, seeking to understand the commonalities that unite them all. He reads, meditates, and repeats until it is time for him to enforce his findings in the bustling streets of District Ten.

  

Tranquil Pond

Tranquil Pond has rented a modest room in a middle-class part of the Tenth District. Little more than a comfortable bed and a desk, it is far from the standard to which he is accustomed. Still, the place is clean and cheerful enough, and he's struck up something of a neighbourly friendship with Vilthuril, the elven woman in the next apartment, the sort of arrangement where they keep an eye on one another's door and say hello in the corridor. Even better, it's close to the clothing shop operated by his second cousin, Radiant Flame - the one on his mother's side that nobody in the family really speaks of. Pond looked up Flame on arrival in the district and he is the only person who knows what happened at home.

  

Vesra

Exhausted and confused about Clays book Vesra returns home to the bulwark in precinct five. Endless stairs and ladders lead to her apartment on top of a tower between sunhome and nivix. She shares her rooms with a crazy goblin inventor Rizzix who's affiliated with the Izzet. Half of her apartment is filled with thing you better not touch if you want to live. The other half is her bed, a small kitchen and a lot of talismans, that prevent the whole level from exploding. The goblin's bed is somewhere in buried under a pile of tesla coils. However they both have a mutual workshop where she keeps her weapons and tools to craft the charms. Also there's a balcony and thanks to the goblin a tap water system which works two out of three times.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Sybil lives in a poorer part of town. As she enters her humble shack, runes and symbols can be seen carved on the door and walls both inside and out. As she enters the accommodation are more comfortable looking on the inside. She enters a trap door in the floor to go down into her hidden library and do more research into the foul thing that has cursed her.

Clay stops at several grocers on his way to the apartments that he rents, for Clay rents three apartments within a rundown tenement building.

  

Entering the building he nods to his landlord an old Loxodon woman who seems to be perpetually wearing the same mumu, and a constantly rotating series of shower caps. As he enters she complains to him, "The goblin boys in 3E painted up the fourth floor hallway again. And those elves are back on the corner again."

  

Setting down his groceries he pulls a notebook and asks her questions about whether she observed the goblins in the hallway. When it was noticed, has she confronted them yet. Then continuing to the elves, how long they've been on the corner, who else has she seen interaction with them. Are they wearing a hat. Did they have any baked goods with them this time. Then proceeds into the building and to the second floor. Carefully entering the apartment, he moves through a worn track between carefully organized stacks of notebooks.

  

Quickly preparing a simple meal, he eats, then washes the dishes, then proceeds to tag and labeling each item with usage and date, before placing them in prelabeled bins in the living room.

  

Leaving his apartment he heads out to the street and informs the three elven prostitutes on the corner that they have been seen loitering and there are witnesses to them performing lewd acts in public and issues them a ticket to appear before the court in three days.

  

Reentering his building he stops on the third floor knocking on the door for 3E. Unfortunately, no one appears to be at home so he notes in a journal to return in the morning to speak with the family and issue additional tickets.

  

Finally, reentering his primary apartment, he documents the happenings of the day, places the journal within a seemingly random stack of books, and then enters its location within another stack of books that appear to be indexes.

  

Heading to sleep early, he wakes up at 3 am and starts the process of baking the cookies and cakes for that afternoon's prayer circle.

  

Bogs Hothands

Ever since his performance, Bogs has appeared more detached and forlorn. He smiles to the others as he leaves. Bogs makes his trek to Griffin Heights in the Second District. He rents a basement apartment with a roommate, a goblin named Vigdig, who was once a bandmate of his. They are friends, but clash when it comes to style of music and general outlook on life. Bogs remembers a time when they were close, but ever since he has been hanging out with members of the Cult of Rakdos, he has become more reckless and violent. Since today, he is exceptionally worried about Vigdig. He wonders if he was in fact in the crowd, cheering the death of his companions.

He approaches the house carefully, as if for the first time. He opens the door carefully. No sign of life down here, but upstairs he hears his landlord and friend, a half-elf named Aslomir, bumping down the stairs, checking to see who it is. He once was a bandmate of both Bogs and Vigdig. But he is now on the straight and narrow, married, two kids, house, dog, cat, and job at the docks.

“Hey bro, I’ve been wondering about you. Usually home by this time. I bet you all really knocked em over tonight.”

“Yea, I um… Can I tell you about it tomorrow? It’s just that there was this crazy thing that happened. I don’t know how we got there. I need to think about it dude. Ok? I need some rest tonight.”

“Oh, yea sure man, it’s cool. Just put your rent in the jar. Remember, it’s been a week already since…”

“Yea, of course. Sorry about that. Goodnight”

Bogs’ apartment is a mess of a place. Instruments of every condition of wear, shape, and size litter the walls and furniture. The dinner table is a makeshift repair stand. Not a feminine touch has graced this junk heap. He shares a kitchenette, living room, and two bedrooms with his roommate. Vigdig’s bedroom has shifted towards badges and strange sharp things that Bogs doesn’t recognize. Bogs bedroom is mostly strewn clothing and instrument repair tools. His bed however, always pulled tight and neat, remnants of his regimented upbringing, is also flung about. Bogs look at it annoyingly, fixes it first, and then rests his head to sleep.

  

'Asifa

Until recently, 'Asifa lived in Precinct Four, in the same areas her now deceased "friends" lived. Just a couple weeks ago she left the place, collected most of her earnings as a mercenary and bought a place in the Concordance of Precinct 3. She just needed to find a quiet place, away from the people and the constant threat of strife she had known for the last couple years. To her delight she found a good sized stone house that reminded her of the home she grew up in. It was in a dilapidated state, none of the rooms fit to live in and the grounds a tangled mess. A real fixer upper. She knew she did not have the skills to fix the place up but she had a vision and the beginnings of a plan. She knew many in the Greenbelt had the skills she needed. She would join the local block watch and peddle her uncanny ability to predict the weather to the farmers and druids. In return, she hope to gain the work of a stonemason, carpenter and groundskeeper.

  

The bloody images of her awful day in her mind, she opened the old wooden door of her new home. She walked to the large kitchen, the only room she'd time to clean up and make livable and sat at a table that came with the house, wood so sturdy that it had stood the tests of time quite well. She rubbed her aching eyes. With her former party dead now she would be alone, but that was just fine with her. She supposed she would rendezvous with the other survivors. Damn fool errand trying to take on the Cult of Rakdos. But what the hell, maybe that weird guy at the bar would be worth talking to. After starting a fire in the kitchen hearth and making some tea from the raspberry leaves out back, 'Asifa wandered her new home: 4 bedrooms, a dining room, sitting room with a second hearth and of course the lovely kitchen. That tight-ass monk said he baked didn't he? The moon was full so she inspected the grounds from one of the upper bedrooms. A good sized property. It was clearly something to behold in its day. She wondered if any of the fruit trees would bear come spring. Tired, 'Asifa fell asleep in her cot in the kitchen hoping for good dreams.

  
  

Bogs Hothands

Having lost his entire band the day before at the Gore House, Bogs contemplates his future. He feels drawn to these new faces that appear etched into his mind, replaying the events of the day before, over and over. He doesn't want to explain it to his upstairs friend, so he sneaks out. The bright light of the morning seems more oppressive than ever. His legs take him straight back to the place that his memories ended the night before. He opens the door, hoping to see a familiar face. Beau's grin is enough to kick his persona back into gear.

  

“Good morning! I think I've played a show at every establishment on Tin Street a dozen times, but I can't recall this place. Although, I can't say I've never been pickled beyond measure. Aside from that, I made a few coin last night, and I don't want to make a bad name for myself, as an honest musician, so what is your policy on gigs here in your fine tavern, friend? Do you require a cut?”

  

Beau turns to Bogs, wiping down some glasses. “Ah, the Niv-Mizzet lookin' feller. A gig here, huh?”

  

“Well, how often are yer looking to play? We don't have a stage, but I can rearrange a bit of space for you, set you up in a corner. A bit of live music wouldn't hurt, long as it's got variety.”

  

Bogs Hothands

“I'm tall enough - no stage necessary. But, what would you say if I played here once a week or so? You could put a sign out front, Live music tonight. Mutually beneficial arrangement I do say.”

  

“Is the kitchen open? I could really go for a half dozen eggs, toast, and some orange juice.

Bogs Hothands gives the man 6 copper coins. He tells the kitchen staff your order.

  

Clay

Awaking before 3 am, Clay fires his oven and then starts mixing the ingredients for his cookies and cake. Once the oven is ready he begins baking what he'll need for the prayer session later in the day. While the cookies and cake is in the over, he eats a quick breakfast of grapefruit and a slice of day old toast. Before entering his living room and retrieving a new empty journal. Heading back to the kitchen to retrieve the cookies to allow them to start cooling, he sits down to prep the journal for daily use and document his morning routine. Retrieving the cake, he then proceeds to wash up for the day and dress. Gathering himself, and his supplies, he exits the apartment and proceeds to apartment 3E to speak with the goblin family

Clay

  

Once again there is no answer, so he issues a ticket for disturbing the piece with a notice to appear. He then exits the apartment, nodding to Mrs. Thornburg, the Loxodon landlady, who sits upon the stoop smoking. He then briskly walks to his assigned watch station to check in for the day.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

  

Sybil walks in her meager apartment and rubs her eyes. She tries to process the happenings of yesterday and discern if it was real or just a horrible dream.

She gets up and dresses herself. Entering her small secret library she tries to find anything on the demon Ansem in her books. After searching she locks up her library and checks the wards placed around her apartment before leaving.

  

Lost in thought as she walks randomly around the town she suddenly finds herself in front of the inn front the night before she left the remaining survivors of the horrible GoreHouse contest. She enters, hopeful that others might have been drawn back here as well...

  

'Asifa awakens early in the morning. She's never been one to sleep in when there's work to be done. And there's always work to be done. She prepares a simple meal of cured meat and eggs and then gets to clearing the brambles at the northeast edge of the property. Electricity pours from her hands with practiced ease, leaving the plants withered and brittle. She then smacks them down with her spear as she reminds herself she really must purchase some proper tools. Finally, as she moves her hands in a circular motion, a stiff breeze blows the broken and charred plants into the corner. Satisfied, she considers the survivors she met last evening. 'Asifa sighs. Maybe some new friends wouldn't be so bad after all. Could give them a chance. She dons her armor and sets off.

  
  

Tranquil Pond's morning is oddly routine today. Despite the horrors of yesterday he follows the old patterns - morning breathing exercises, a quick hello to Vilthuril as he passes her at the door to the building, breakfast of grilled fish, rice, and tea at the shop near his apartment.

  

As he eats he thinks on the other survivors of the Gorehouse and realizes he is unexpectedly fond of, or at least intrigued by, the unusual little band. He notes he will need a new source of income now that his old party is no more. Well, why not.

  

With that, he returns to his room, gathers his staff and other gear, and heads for Beau's.

  

Clay

Completing his shift Clay returns home and cleans up, before leaving to a local veterans hall where he holds his biweekly service for his faithful. Today was a good day, as a majority of his flock arrived for service, three drunks looking for free cookies and cake. As per normal the service lasts exactly 48 minutes, consisting of the ritual of greeting, the reading of prophecy, and the accounting of days. 42 minutes are then left over for coffee, cookies, cake, and most importantly conversation.

Returning home, Clay, greets his Loxodon landlady who stops him to complain about how loud the messenger boys and drug runners are. "Don't they know this used to be a good Neighborhood. And why are they always running, there's no need to always be running, it's too loud. There should be a law" Clay informs her that there is not a law, but that several regulations could apply. These being Code 445.a.Zq21 and 326.b1.Ar2, and depending on direction, clothing colors, and whether they have recently bathed 1123.B.Z42

He then cleans the dishes, tags and labels them and stores them in a stack within his second apartment. Leaving, he once again greets his landlady before returning to Beau's to see if the others might be there and have additional information.

  

Garreth began his morning routine: a run/climb up the terraces to a secluded overlook. He meditated on the unnatural events from the previous day, unsettled that such a heinous event could draw crowds, let alone operate freely. He tried to shake off the visions of carnage, and instead focus on what dysfunctions within Ravnica's core could manifest in such a shocking manner.

He reflected on the other survivors, and how their energies seemed attuned. While the solution to that glorification of slaughter was out of reach, he sensed the first step was to unite his new brothers in blood to fight back against it.

A new direction in mind, he set out for the tavern in the hopes of reconnecting with the remaining survivors

  

On arrival at Beau's, Tranquil Pond approaches Bogs where he sits awaiting his breakfast. He twitches an ear in casual greeting. “I see you had the same idea I did, my friend.”

Bogs looks up and seems genuinely pleased to see Pond. Bogs’ demeanor shifts slightly as he glances over either shoulder to see if anyone can hear them. Pond's ears swivel reflexively as he sees Bogs turn his head.

  

Bogs Hothands

“Hey. Um... can I confess something to you? I feel like we made a little connection yesterday at the gore house.”

  

A slow smile crosses Pond's face, eyes narrowing in a feline grin. “Speak freely, Master Hothands. My attention is all yours.”

  

Garreth

This connection has brought us together once more, willingly this time.

Garreth takes a seat beside Tranquil Pond.

  

Bogs Hothands is nervous. “My band mates were really just that, band mates, on a professional level. Well except, Tarlak. He was a true asshole. That’s besides the point... but Ella. Ella was.,. She, um, understood me.”

  

Tranquil Pond

“Ah. A matter... of the heart, I gather. You were... together?”

Bogs Hothands “I don’t really have a ton of friends. And I really only just met them. But she was different from the rest of them, than anyone I’ve met really..”

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond leans forward, resting his elbow on the table and his chin on his paw.

Bogs Hothands “We weren’t “together” per se, but I’ve never really had that before, so I don’t know what that means exactly, but…”

Bogs stops talking and burrows his head under his hands. After a minute or so, Bogs looks up at Pond.

  

Pond slides his gaze to Garreth briefly, expression bland. He turns back to the collapsing dragonborn and waits, expecting clarification.

  

Bogs Hothands

“Thanks man. I don’t usually act like this. I’m just not sure what happened yesterday was real. I mean, what about you? I remember your friend sacrificed himself to save you. Does any of this seem right?”

  

Pond's pensive gaze on Bogs is long and measured. He laces his fingers together in front of his face in a thoughtful pose. “Right... What is right? This is a world where death is a certainty. I believe my comrade saw his own coming soon in any case. Or perhaps he thought there was no way he would best me in close quarters…”

A smile. “...which would have been true.”

  

Only just realizing that Garreth was sitting next to Pond, Bogs straightens back up in his chair composing himself.

Tranquil Pond: “In any event, the outcome is that we are here and they are not, however that came about. You are free to make choices now. I have chosen to accompany you and these others, for the moment, for my own amusement. And I will be free to leave you should you cease to entertain me. So, dragon-man, what choice will you make now?”

  

Bogs Hothands sits in his chair with a fresh, confident outlook on life. “Right, right. Of course. One of you had to go on, and he figured that fighting you seemed like a fool’s errand.”

Pond inclines his head as if he has made a point. Garreth regards Tranquil Pond and nods thoughtfully.

Bogs Hothands looks around, flustered. “What time is it? Perhaps I need an ale to clear my head.”

Tranquil Pond “Ah... it is about an hour past sunrise.”

Garreth “I do not doubt that your head is swirling with emotion, Master Hothands. What happened to your friends is not an easy thing to digest.”

Tranquil Pond: “Particularly if one was... special.”

Garreth: “Yes, I imagine that would add an even deeper layer.”

Bogs Hothands is brooding over this. “Right? Thank you Garreth. I do not regret burning Tarlak though, I must say.”

  

Pond turns his head to regard Garreth. His lips draw up to show just the hint of a fang.

With a mocking tone, he says “Yes, Garreth, your counsel was invaluable.”

  

Garreth either does not hear, or outright ignores TP's sarcastic tone. He continues to Bogs.

  

Bogs Hothands

“After joining them, practicing, traveling, and playing several shows. He never acknowledged my presence, not once.” Pond returns his face to neutral and leans back in his chair to listen.

Garreth “Your mind, then, is as clear as it needs to be. There is room for action and, to an extent, reflection. But not regret. Not self-pity. Not self-doubt. We survived that gauntlet for a reason, and we now must rise to the task at hand.”

Bogs Hothands: “I give everyone the benefit of doubt, but yea, he deserved that shit. Asshole!”

Garreth : “Remember your lost friends as they were, if it comforts you. But do not dwell. They now belong to a world that no longer exists.”

  

Pond brings a paw in front of his face and regards his claws nonchalantly.” Besides, if not them, it would have been you.”

Bogs Hothands: “No, Pond. I thank both of you. To be honest, I get into a tussle almost every night. There’s always some douchebag trying to steal from you, or break your shit, but…”

He pauses.

“I’ve never actually killed a man. I bet you guys have killed plenty.”

Tranquil Pond “Perhaps, fellow, perhaps. Do you now wish you had? Killed a man, I mean.”

Bogs Hothands “Well yeah. I did. Tarlak. That surprisingly felt good. Is that wrong?” Pond shrugs with a sly smile.

Garreth “There should be no pleasure found in the act of violence, Master Hothands. But it is often difficult to distinguish what feels good and what feels right.”

Tranquil Pond is amused. “Who am I to say what is wrong?”

Bogs Hothands: It’s in my blood perhaps. I mean, I can breath fucking FIRE! Am I right?”

Tranquil Pond smirks. “Who am I to say what is right?”

Garreth “There is an undeniable catharsis that comes from doing what is right - even if that course of action demands the sacrifice of life. Master Hothands, I do not believe that you have a particular hunger for murder or senseless violence. I think that catharsis is what you felt when Tarlak's time on this plane was brought to a close.”

  

“It is our duty to say what is wrong and what is right. Moreover, it is our duty to hold others accountable to that same standard. This is precisely why we made it out of that nightmare when so many others fell.”

  

Pond's ears shift to bring his face into an ironic cat-smirk.

Bogs Hothands: “...Is our duty to find those responsible and kick their measly asses off this plane?”

Tranquil Pond “My friend, I was about to say that there is an undeniable catharsis that comes from ridding oneself of an annoyance. You have scratched the itch, slapped the fly. If we have a responsibility to do that, then I am all for it.”

Garreth You both have the right of it. Just as the first gods were born out of chaos to give order to the void, so must our band of survivors deliver justice to the mayhem that brought us together.”

Tranquil Pond:” Justice, you say... how interesting…”

Garreth “Yes, in the cosmic sense. We who lead lives of discipline and meditation bear the burden of understanding the laws of nature, and further executing them.”

Pond's ears flatten briefly. “Oh, yes, certainly. And such a burden it is!”

Garreth: “Although your training may differ from mine, those who are called to our profession possess a certain character. I am truly glad to begin this undertaking with you as an ally.”

The feline man tilts his head as he regards the human, as if trying to assess something. After a long moment he looks away before sliding his eyes back to the table in front of Garreth. ”...And I with you, of course, brother.”

  

Syb enters Beau's and looks around. Spotting the familiar faces from the Gorehouse, she walks over and sits at the bar next to them.

  

Tranquil Pond inclines his head to Sybil.

Sybil Shadowblight “So..you felt it as well then? This...connection?”

Tranquil Pond smiles ironically, eyes squinting and ear turning. “Connection? I suppose one might call my interest a connection. I take it your coming here is due to more than simple curiosity or boredom then?”

  

'Asifa walks into the bar with a grin. “Well, well if it isn't most of the lucky bastards back for more! Morning! I couldn't let you go killing yourselves out of revenge or justice or principal or some such. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on you guys.”

  

Tranquil Pond's ears flatten slightly and his tone is even flatter as he addresses 'Asifa. “Yes. Good. Thank you for being our savior.”

  

Garreth nods at each new arrival in turn, stoic as ever. The brightness in his eyes intensifies, betraying his growing excitement as the group reassembles. He looks to 'Asifa:

“ I assure you, I have no intention of dying just yet. We have far too much to accomplish before our final rest.”

'Asifa is taken aback to this. She leans to Pond: “Ha, savior! I gotta say, I just hate the sound of that!” Pond leans forward and rests his chin on his laced fingers to regard 'Asifa. “Wonderful, me neither!”

Tranquil Pond to Asifa: “Then that makes two of us.”

  

Vesra spent most of the night crafting. She got a certain feeling, there will be some need.

  

The next day she wakes up early over her work on the desk. Rizzix already scurries around working on something he calls orb of detection, whatever that is. Good thing, he made some drinkable coffee and left some fruits and ham for her as breakfast so Vesra doesn't have to hunger, since she didn't buy groceries after yesterday's events. Ahead of her day in the Boron garrison is her favorite part of the day: She gets ready and then enjoys the sunrise over the endless city from the balcony. The spirit of the sun is really generous to an angel like her! She finishes her mug and leaves it on a small table for Rizzix to clean up. Who's that noisy so early in the morning can help a bit with house holding. Vesra takes a deep breath and jumps!!

  

10... 15 meters into free fall she opens her wings and glides between the buildings and above the transguild promenade. Vesra adores her morningly flight before everyone is stressed and the streets are crowded. It disconnects herself from the world and only the spirits of the air can reach her.

  

Arriving at the garrison she spends a day of work not much worth mentioning besides a small raid in a suspected Dimir-owned shop.

  

In the evening she goes again to beau's tavern in hope she meets her new acquaintances, just right to answer: No, actually three!

  

She greets everyone.

  

Pond's ear twitches in Garreth's direction. He raises a whiskery eyebrow inquisitively. “And just what is it you feel we need to... accomplish?”

Garreth “To restore order to Ravnica's foundation. It has been clear for ages that all of the politicking of the Azorius has done more to cloud the spirit of the law than clarify it. Even the Boros' mission of divine justice is a bandage for that which ails Ravnica, not a cure. There is a sickness in its core that has been allowed to fester, and our trial yesterday was but one gruesome symptom.”

Tranquil Pond: “Ah, yes. That little matter of your cosmic duty. Well, I shall be on hand for constructive criticism and witty commentary; you need not even ask, my friend!”

Garreth:  “I am truly grateful for your support, Tranquil Pond. And I sense that you're rather... lighthearted... worldview may be a welcome respite to our new companions.”

  

Vesra takes a seat with them. “So. Where do you wanna start? Just go over to Rakdos like’ Hey buddy, I don't like how your folks slaughter random citizens, can you tell them to stop?’”

Garreth: “This is the failing of the Azorius, who believe that the word of law is sufficient. Now is the time for action. There will be no trials, no litigation.”

Tranquil Pond smirks. “Really. I should wonder how Master Clay would view such an approach.”

Garreth: “I believe this connection you all feel is borne of our innate understanding of what is right. We are guided by the same energy towards a natural order. That we survived to reconvene here proves that we possess the capacity and fortitude to stand in the face of the forces of chaos. It is therefore our responsibility to take matters into our own hands - to succeed where traditional means have failed.

The word of law can be easily manipulated, but we will show Ravnica that the spirit is constant and absolute.”

Pond watches the rest of the group carefully, assessing their reactions to Garreth's assertion.

Vesra looks up, fascinated by the word spirits usually she gets ignored for her mentions of these entities.

Vesra hands Garreth one of the talismans she made last night with a knowing look. It's a miniature of a turtle with concentric circles on the shell.

'Asifa: “that all sounds well and good, Garreth, but I'm going to need something somewhat more immediate and practical to focus my attention on. We have to be realistic. Let's find ourselves a private corner and agree on a first step. A first step toward greater things if you must.”

  

Clay enters the restaurant, and looks around. Seeing the others, he approaches.

Sybil sits quietly listening to the others talk. Tranquil Pond gives a mock bow to Clay without getting up. “Good morrow, Master Clay. I apologize for my future transgressions.”

Clay: “Evening, everyone.”

Sybil Shadowblight : “So what brought you back to Beau's?

Clay: “I realized I never conducted interviews.”

Tranquil Pond “Oh, I believe you are right. Such a procedural oversight! We had best rectify that immediately, is it not so?” Pond's tail waves slowly back and forth in his humorous mood.

Sybil Shadowblight: “I came back for revenge, you cannot tell me no one else here is not here for the same. And I believe that filthy Ansem might be connected to the thing that cursed me.”

Bogs Hothands: “So, here we are, a band, per se. Don't worry. I won't ask you to join my actual band, unless you want to. 50% cut. I'm half surprised that you came back, Clay. Do you think we have a better chance of bringing the perpetrators to justice more than Ravnica's finest? Would filing an official complaint accomplish anything?”

Clay: “If you do an interview, I could stand in the room and just look intimidating. Come on, it'll be fun.” Sitting down, he pulls out a notebook, turning to Tranquil Pond he asks;

“What is the last thing you remember before waking up in the Gorehouse?”

  

Pond winks at Bogs Hothands. “Feel free to loom intimidatingly. It will set the tone.”

He looks to Clay. “I was eating my breakfast. Not baked goods, I am afraid - fish and rice.”

Bogs fights against a smirk from surfacing, and stands up. Crossing his arms he paces back and forth behind Tranquil Pond, quietly mumbling; “Hmmf. Fish and rice can be hard to come by.” Clay writes this down. “What type of fish, was it fried, baked, or grilled?”

  

Tranquil Pond “Trust you, Master Clay, to ask the hard-hitting questions. Grilled, as is my ritual.”

Bogs leans over sniffing the back of Pond's neck.

Bogs Hothands: “Checks out. Slight tinge of char…

  

Clay: “White rice or brown? His many washes did you do?”

  

“White. And define washes...?”

  

“One who eats rice on the regular would know that washing the rice prior to cooking it, removes much of the starch. A common technique. I am not so sure we are getting all the facts here. Answer the question my feline friend!”

  

Pond's ear flicks at Bogs as the dragonborn leans down into his personal space. “Buy me a drink first, would you?” Bogs retreats from Pond's personal space, and returns to pacing. He apologizes. “I'll get you a drink though. What would you like?”

  

Garreth: “Master Clay, your investigative habits are... thorough. They would be best suited towards finding, as 'Asifa suggested, a concrete course of action. Could we start with any of your usual, Rakdos-aligned suspects?”

  

Clay: “How many times did you wash the rice to remove excess starch? And did you make this in your home or someplace else?”

  

Tranquil Pond cannot stifle his grin at Bogs' shifting demeanor. “Water, please.” Giving Pond a returning wink, Bogs turns and approaches the bartender.

  

 He continues with the investigation.

“Oh, my dear man, you mistake me entirely. Yesterday I said I do not bake. I should have said I do not cook. There is a shop which I frequent. You will have to make enquiries with them in relation to the washing of rice.”

  

Clay: “Ahh, so you were in public, were you with anyone? Did you see anything unusual?”

  

Bogs: “Water please. Say, is that employee of yours working again tonight, who happens to be a member of the Cult of Rakdos?”

  

Pond snorts a little. “No. And also no.” He meets Garreth's gaze out of the corner of his eye.

“I hope this little interview is contributing to cosmic justice in some small way.”

  

Garreth: “Perhaps this is a test of character. Master Clay seems to be pushing the limits of our patience. You, my friend, are performing admirably.

  

Garreth looks to Vesra. “Thank you for this totem. You seem to radiate strength. Does an energy flow through you, as well?”

  
  
  

Tranquil Pond: “But it is so important to ensure all relevant information is recorded! Take note, that you may provide similar clarity during your statement.” Pond's eyes crinkle in mirth.

Garreth: “I am not one for statements. And you are correct - relevant information is most useful.”

  

Tranquil Pond: “Sir Garreth. You may not be... but you wouldn't stand in the way of justice, would you?” The feline gaze flicks to Clay and back to Garreth in a wordless suggestion.

Garreth responds to the feline man. “Statements often delay justice. At a certain point, gathering information just becomes so much noise - it distracts from the clarity we need to act.”

  

Tranquil Pond sits there smirking at Garreth's words. His eyes travel to each of the others in this newfound group briefly, before he closes his eyes. “I look forward to seeing this come to fruition.”

Garreth: ”Brother, I could not agree more.”

  

Vesra whispers to Garreth: “Strength is what you have to accomplish yourself, but this little turtle represents the spirit of this world in balance you are seeking! Keep it close to you and you may achieve your goal!”

Garreth whispers to Vesra: “I will treasure this totem, that its spirit may guide me in the challenging times to come. It will be an honor to fight by your side.”

  

Vesra smiles at Garreth. She's happy her work gets to be appreciated. With more energy she tries to follow the conversation. Too many useless words - too few acts.

  

Garreth withdraws from the conversation, having said more on his beliefs in one evening than he'd ever before articulated - to relative strangers, no less. He turns his attention to the bar's patrons, scanning for signs of suspicious activity...

  

Sybil Shadowblight is visibly annoyed.” Not to be rude, but how is any of this counting rice washing going to help us get revenge?” She gets closer so that Clay can hear what she has to say; “Here is my statement... I was walking towards the Rakdos district to investigate what I thought was a lead in my search.. turns out it was a trap.... I was cornered and knocked out. Then… I woke up in that terrible place.”

Clay: “It wasn't, when he informed me when he was doing I asked basic follow ups to determine if he had violated any regulations and would need to be cited.

As for gathering details, sometimes the smallest details lead to an arrest. Cross checking your stories could lead to similarities that could lead to who did this.

  

Painstakingly moving through what occurred and any evidence left behind catches mistakes made by the perpetrators. And everyone makes mistakes. Everyone involved must face justice.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight contemplates the events of that faithful day. “I did have rice for dinner the evening I was taken…”

  

Beau hands bogs a glass of water. “Sorry it's taking a while. Yer food's on the way, my scaly friend.

  

Beau's isn't as busy in the noontime, but there's still a few friendly faces here and there, recovering from the night before with the usual eggs and bacon. Aside from the party, there's only about 5 or so stragglers.

In the middle of the investigation, Clay’s eyes dart at someone who’s just now walking into Beau’s. Judging from his expression, the present party sees a hint of familiarity.

  

# Chapter 4: Azorius, Corrupt

An Azorius Enforcer, from the looks of it. Standing at 6'2'', wearing heavy armor from head to toe, he naturally commands attention from all around. His face looks as though it's been a long day. On his belt, a holstered short sword with blue runes written along the blade.

  

All the patrons see the man enter and sit at the bar, facing an alert and alarmed Beau. Casual talk and whispers stop. Slowly, without a sound, the patrons leave one by one, until only the party, Beau and the man are left.

  

Enforcer

“...The usual, Beau.”

  

Beau nervously grabs ice and a bottle of whiskey from his shelf. His hands shake as he pours the man his drink. The large man grabs Beau's hand as he pours from the bottle, his eyes fixed to Beau's. “...don't spill precious whiskey.”

  

Beau takes in a deep breath, and calms his nerves enough to pour confidently. The patron lights a cigarette, not bothering to take his helmet off. As he smokes and drinks, he looks over his shoulder to take a look at the party.

Sybil Shadowblight is now more annoyed. “What are you looking at!?”

  

He continues to stare. Pond gives the man a wave that's a little sultry, wiggling his fingers as he grins with half-closed eyes.

  

Vesra looks confused. “What's wrong with this guy?”

The Azoruis turns back, enjoying his smoke and drink. Beau has walked a notable distance away from him.

  

I'm also assuming Clay is "known" amongst the arrestors- likely as being a crazy loon

Clay

“Apologies mistress.” The man says. He takes a sip of his whiskey.

  

Clay stands up, he pulls his logbook and approaches the Enforcer.

“Greetings Officer, it is good to see another Azorius Arrestor.”

“Unfortunately, I did not see you pay for your beverage. As you know that is a violation of the Arrestor Code Book. Article 12, paragraph 3, Subsection 2. States that we must avoid any sense of impropriety both in and off duty. I must inform you that you have failed to do so.”

  

“Here is your ticket, please appear before the local senate court next Svogsday at 10 am. Please apologize and pay the bartender. And thank you, Citizen.” Clay hands the ticket to the Enforcer.

  

Tranquil Pond is observing this exchange with unconcealed interest. He leans forward and rests his chin on a curled paw, grinning surreptitiously at the other members of his group.

  

The man looks at Clay, his expression as serious as a graveyard.

He takes a drag of his cigarette, blows it in Clay's face, and puts it out.

“...you're giving me a ticket before I've even had a chance to pay my tab? Beau, how many times have I been here? You thinkin' I'd ever run off before i'd pay my dues?”

Beau: “No, I don't think you've ever skipped out on paying sir.” The man stands up his full height, looking at Clay. He finishes his whiskey, not breaking eye contact, and slams a handful of silver coins on the table. 

“A lot of young blood knights think they can just hand out tickets like candy. Often in a self-serving way.”

  

Clay looks at the officer's sword. “Officer, drinking while carrying an Azorius approved weapon is a violation of the LEHSA act and Article 12 Paragraph 7, Subsection 3. I regretfully must cite you as such.” Withdraws the first ticket and writes out a second ticket and hands it to the officer.

“It is unfortunate if that is the case. Please report them to the duty watch. If you feel you cannot report those officers misusing their authority please inform myself and I will observe, ticket, and report.”

  

'Asifa looks at Pond, her eyes raised in a mix of concern and amusement.

Clay holds the ticket still in his outstretched hand.

“And as always, Have a Good Day Citizen.”

  

As Clay is writing the ticket, the Arrestor grabs his ticket pad right from Clay’s belt. The Azorius Senate emblem appears on his gauntlet, and the ticket pad burns in a bright blue flame.

  

Enforcer: “Citizen? Never heard a someone call their superior that.”

He gets up, and brushes past you.

  

Clay: “Officer, I'm sorry but I must arrest you for the destruction of Azorius property and interfering with a sworn officer in the dutiful carrying out of their duty. Please stand up and place your hands behind your back. I thank you for following this dutifully issued command.”

  

Enforcer: “Get a new ticket pad from Law Mage Callen. 3rd Floor, Logistics. Fill out a proper report. Stating you were detained by Enforcer Jameson Ebadaya for misconduct and abuse of power off the clock.”

  

Clay: “Sir, I have issued you a lawful command. Please turn around and put your hands behind your back.”

  

Jameson: “From a mere functionary? Uh huh.”

Beau meekly says “Have a good one, James.”

  

Clay: “In the eyes of the law all are seen as equal.”

  

Jameson does not even bother to look back as he heads outside of Beau's. Clay follows Jameson Ebadaya out of the bar. “Officer James, please stop and turn yourself over for arrest. If you do not, I will unfortunately take that as it means that you are resisting a lawfully issued order.”

  
  

As Clay follow Jameson, he is rejoined by his 3 squadmates. They’ve been eating donuts from a nearby vendor, eyes out for troublemakers. Upon seeing their leader and a fellow Azorius guildsman, they clear a path for him and stand shoulder to shoulder.

  

Jameson stops, turns to stare at Clay. The two knights look to Clay, then Jameson.

  

Clay: ”Thank you, sir.” He then moves forward, pulling a set of restraints off his belt. He moves to go behind Jameson Ebadaya and apply the restraints.

  
  

James looks at the two men. “Arrest this man.”

All three men draw their swords and their shields, the Azorius Emblem projecting off of it.

  

Clay: “Officers, Jameson Ebadaya has violated the LEHSA Act, and Article 12, Paragraph 7, Subsection 3 of the Azorian Arrestors Code.”

  

The Shield Guard moves to Clay and swings his sword at him. His sword slides off Clay’s plate armor.

  

Clay drops the restraints and draws his axe and shield, the Azorian symbol projecting off it.”

“STOP! IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!”

  

Sword Guard becomes frightened at this strong declaration. While shield guard and Jameson remain confident.

  

Sword Guard runs at Clay and slashes with his longsword.

Vesra

29th Sep 2019

Vesra rushes to them.

“You can't just attack my friend for following the law!” She draws her axe but doesn't attack yet.

The Sword Guard cowers and whimpers.

Sword Guard flanks a bit to your left, not getting any closer.

Jameson draws his sword. It glows intensely, emitting an almost blinding blue light.

  

He moves to you, and swings his sword twice. At his second strike, Jameson hits your pauldron with such force, your armor dents.

  

'Asifa goes up to the door to see what exactly the frick is going on. “Well shit, Clay is getting the snot beat out of him isn't. Shit, Vesra, what are you…”

  

Shield Guard flanks behind you, and attacks.

His sword again slides off your armor.

  

“That's enough!” Vesra's wings twitching as she rages and attacks the guard who just attacked.

  

Syb takes the last bites of her breakfast and then casually gets up and heads outside. Pond follows Sybil with a casual shrug.

  
  

Garreth's eyes blaze with radiant fury. He strides towards the melee.

  

Vesra Attacks also the guard is struck by a lightning.

Shield guard is hit, but still able to fight.

Clay: “LAWBREAKERS! Drop your weapons and submit to the LAW!” Clay attacks Jameson..

  

Bogs was taking his good sweet time on the shitter. He returns to the bar, only to find nobody in it. He hears the clash of blades outside, and the screaming of what sounds like Clay.

  

Bogs leaps across the room, swinging his battle tested metal drum around in one motion, making for the exit.

  

Jameson takes a hit, but it barely affects him. He remains unphased. Sword guard puts a scroll from his belt. He begins to bark orders into it.

  

“This is Sergeant Alder, we have a code 42, rogue Azorius functionary, 6 '6'', Chainmail and Axe. He's attacking his superiors with no basis of reason. All units within a mile radius , converge at Beau's. Be advised, 4 other persons, One Fallen Angel, One Cat.”

  

Sword Guard is no longer frightened.

Jameson attacks Clay again, with two strikes of his glowing blade. “They've drawn their weapons! Officers; use lethal force until they surrender.”

  

Jameson's blue blade sizzles as it cuts through Clay's armor, breaking some of his ribs, but not puncturing his organs.

  

Clay falls to the ground, clutching his open wound.

Shield Guard mobilizes, swinging his weapon at Vesra. She narrowly dodges his attack.

  

Shield Guard: “Surrender or die!”

Pond observes the doorway is blocked and even should he wish to lay a punch on the enforcer he could not reach. He decides to try the other method. He raises his voice to a tone audible to the Azorians. “Master Enforcer. Surely you all have more heinous crimes to be dealing with. What about ten gold each for you and your men as recompense for the inconvenience?”

  

Jameson Ebadaya: “Noble Azorius cannot be bought. Neither do we don't abuse our powers.

This one will be stripped of his rank and jailed should he survive. The longer you all fight me, the worse this becomes.”

”SURRENDER. NOW.”

  
  

Shield Guard: drop your weapons and face the ground!

Sword Guard: Drop your arms, NOW

Tranquil Pond smirks. “Surely you see I carry no weapons.”

  

Shield Guard: Then get on the ground, hands over your head!

Garreth steps resolutely through the door, positioning himself between Vesra and the guards.

  

Tranquil Pond

“I am not standing on the ceiling. But, since you insist…” Pond raises his hands over his head. His fingers might briefly be making a rude gesture at the guards, or it might be a trick of the light.

  

Garreth: “Azorius infighting? You all are but agents of chaos. Stand down and repent, in the name of Aurelia.”

  

Sword Guard: Get on the ground! drop your weapons!

Garreth: “Stand down, pretender. Order will be restored.”

  

A large crowd has formed around the fight. Clay's armor is painted in blood. Some thievious looking bunch eye Clay's belongings.

  

Jameson Ebadaya: “Enough talk. Drop. Your. Weapons. Get on the floor, hands behind your head.”

  

Garreth sees the situation has unraveled, and resolves to put a quick end to it. He draws his sword and drives it towards Jameson.

  

Jameson deftly moves out of the way.

  

Garreth channels his ki to weave between combatants, moving 35 feet to the opposite side of the fray. Step of the Wind

Vesra swings her Greataxe again against the guard. Lighting twitches between her tail and wings and sparks over to Jameson.

  

Vesra's greataxe hits Jameson square in the rib, lighting shoots from the wound. Then she moves out of the doorway to let her companions join the fight.

  

His armor now carries a slight impression of an axeblade. His face winces in pain, but he's more than capable to go on.

  

Asifa gathers mana in her fingertips, her eyes go solid white. She throws a solid bolt of electricity at the Enforcer through the bar door.

  

The bolt hits Jameson where Vesra's axe hit, his face wretched in pain as electricity shoots throughout his body. He loses his footing for a moment, but regains his composure. Whatever hair he had under that helmet, You can smell it singed by fire.

  

Bogs comes galavanting across the bar, whilst beating his drum. bardic inspiration. He steps up behind Pond. He then smiles at the sword guard, and reaches into a pocket, revealing a touch of snake skin and honeycomb, rubs them on his hands, finally beating on his drum while speaking to the guard carrying a sword. “Why don’t you open another scroll, and tell your brothers in arms that everything is under control here. Go back to your stations.”

  

Syb stands to the side with Pond, for now staying out of the fight. Pond gives Sybil a sidelong feline grin. ”A wise woman, I see.”

  

'Asifa whispers to Bogs Hothands “Did you say that using Healing Word was a class feature?”

  

Clay’s wound gash is large. You summon enough self control to slow your breathing, slowing the blood flow. Beau's Barfront - New timeline event(click to show/hide)

  

Jameson takes a strike at Vesra.

  

Sybil Shadowblight  to Tranquil Pond

“Should we help out?!”

  

Vesra

Even with the numbing adrenaline coursing through her veins, that slash hurt. His sword burns as it cuts through your clothes; a horizontal slash across your torso, underneath your breasts.

  
  

Jameson Ebadaya

“Stand down, by decree of an Azorius Enforcer!”

  

From the North side, arrive 2 more Azorius Knights. One wields a spear, and the other A metal staff, alight with a blue glowing stone. A Law Mage, it seems.

  
  

Shield Guard: Reinforcements have arrived.

Sword Guard feels a compulsion to use his scroll, only to stop, questioning his actions. He replaces his scroll back into his belt.

  

Tranquil Pond to Sybil Shadowblight

“Should we? Probably not. But it will entertain.” Pond flows forward like a deluge, lunging toward the door and the guards. As he moves he pulls his staff from the holster on his back and begins spinning it faster and faster. He turns it sideways to make it through the door and attempts a heavy two-handed crack on the chin of the guard wielding the sword.

  

Without losing his momentum, Pond whirls around to land a roundhouse kick on the face of Jameson the enforcer. Tranquil misses his staff strike, but uses the momentum to do a spinning roundhouse hit to the Enforcer. It lands squarely in the ribs giving his plate mail a slight dent on the side.

  

Shield Guard makes a slash at Vesra

  

The attacks incinerate Vesra's rage! More and more lightning sparks out of her.

Shield Guard's blade meets Vesra's torso, but does little damage.

  

Garreth stretches out a hand towards the Enforcer, calling upon the powers of the celestials.

“Be cleansed!”

  

Garreth Guiding Bolt

  

Jameson takes the bolt to the shoulder, his pauldron radiating a painful light. He takes a knee in pain for a moment, but gets up in obvious pain.

He's hurt.

  

Asifa's bolt hits Jameson with enough force to stagger him, but the angle of attack lets most of the bolt slide off his armor. He's breathing heavily, some blood splattered around his mouth.

  
  

takes the chance and recklessly attacks Jameson to end him. Lightning splashes over to the enforcer as she tries to bury her axe into his body.

  

Bogs sees that Clay hasn't moved in some time, and that a gash has opened across his chest. He moves past his comrades, just north of Clay, and administers aid, chanting a healing word.

As he comes to, Bogs helps him to his feet.

  

Clay Stands up, and looks at Jameson Ebadaya

“You… are in multiple violations of the LEHSA Act, Destruction of Property, and the Azorian Arrestors Codebook. Please lay down your arms and submit to arrest!”

  

Vesra's attack hits, blood seeping out from Jameson's now exposed bare chest. A line of blood flows out his mouth. He's hurt badly

.

Clay's blade meets nothing as Jameson desperately dodges his blow in a panic.

  

Spear Guard: Drop your weapons!

Running from the crowd, an Azorius Soldier runs 25 feet towards Bogs and jabs his spear at him.

  

His spear catches between the dragonborn's scales, letting a bit of blood out.

Lawmage: Sir, you're hurt! retreat for now!

  

The lawmager's gauntlets project a large Azorius symbol as she chants her words in an unfamiliar language. She looks over to Bogs. Dominate Person

Her words put you in an odd state of mind, as if you were taking your mother's orders for acting up. You resist… Nope, you were definitely in the wrong. You find yourself anxious to do whatever the Lawmage tells you to.

  

Jameson retreats, stepping backwards 30 feet. From his belt he produces a glass bottle filled with a red, viscous liquid. Popping the cork off, he gulps it down in 3 gulps. No visible change occurs.

  

Jameson Ebadaya coughing blood “Officers, bind that lizard!(Vesra)”

Jameson dodges Clay's strike narrowly

  

Pond stands imperiously to his full height, eyeing the newcomers. His eye first falls on the guard who speared Bogs. (to spear guard) “Rude. This reptile is mine.”

He whirls his staff two-handed and brings it horizontal to jab the guard in the groin. He takes the hit. Tranquil Pond Seeing the staff has swung wide he follows up with a quick knee to the same spot on the guard.

  
  

Spear guard parries your staff strike, looking at you with dead eyes for attacking his wedding tackle. Pond attempts a raising knee to the peepee. Spear guard takes a single step back, his fish eye stare to haunt your dreams forever.

  

Pond glares back unperturbed, staff at the ready.

Shield Guard backs up in front of Jameson, his shield raised for any incoming attacks to his superior.

  

Tranquil Pond Staff attack on whoever moved first 1d20 (+5) = 9 for 1d8 (+3) = 10 damage

Garreth, enraged at the lawmage's blasphemous use of power, closes the distance.

  

Garreth attacks with his shortsword. He follows through with a jab with his offhand and body kick.

  

Garreth ponders if the Lawmage is skilled in close combat, as he dodges all of his blows.

  

Vesra kneels for a moment just to jump upwards. She opens her wings and passes the shielded guard to get behind the enforcer. Using her tempo to strike him from above while landing.

On impact a lightning flashes Jameson, too.

  

As Jameson moves out of range of her Witch Bolt, 'Asifa changes her focus to the guards in front of her and will attack the one that allows her to get as close to Jameson as possible without putting her in danger.

  

Hope that makes sense. Want to get as close to Jameson as I can but can't get to him so will attack a guard. I can't picture the exact positions, just looking to avoid AoO.

  

Bogs defends and preserves himself until otherwise directed...

  

The Storm Genasi grabs hold of Shield Guard's Hilt, and delivers a heavy shock, his metal armor offering no protection. A light layer of dead skin turned ash covers his face.

  

Bogs Hothands

With no order barked upon the enchantment, you guard remains up, awaiting command.

Clay: “PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR AIDING AND ABETTING A CRIMINAL.”

  

Clay Attacks the sword knight but misses.

Sybil Shadowblight: “Well. I guess I'll get involved after all...Clay, are you going to arrest me for helping you?”

  

Sybil Shadowblight eyes flare red and her skin begins to glow softly, she raises her hands and points them at the sword knight. Eldritch blast

  

The eldritch blast missed the sword knight completely

  

Spear Guard: Fire Formation!

Spear Guard maneuvers between the lawmage, sword guard and shield guard, attacking Vesra.

  

As Spear Guard moves back, Pond sees his chance.

He slashes at him vertically up, the blade catching flesh and dislodging his helmet.

The helmet falls, along with Spear Guard's left ear and the flesh around it.

Spear guard moves on, and fails as he jabs Vesra.

  

Sword Guard disengages and moves back to Jameson. Sword, Spear and Shield now form a human shield on Jameson's right side.

Sword Guard: “Lawmage, NOW!”

  

A serious expression as the mage's hands swirl, as if forming a ball. In her hands forms a ball of blue fire.

  

The ball grows in size, until it's a watermelon sized, swirling mass of destruction.

Scorching Ray at 4th Level. 5 Rays:

  

Law Mage: “Dragonkin! Protect our Enforcer!”

Vesra barely notices the magical command as the rays burn her skin and some of her armor.

  

A ray hits Clay, scorch marks on his armor and open wound. He falls to the ground.

  

Jameson takes yet another healing potion and gulps it down. “That was my last one. defend me, boys.”

  

Pond grins at his nearby companions and blurs into a high-speed run, taking off in the direction of the Law Mage [Step of the Wind]. At the last moment before reaching the mage he leaps into the air, planting the point of his staff in the ground and vaulting past it. The staff whirls over his head and he brings it down with both hands on the head of the mage.

  

Tranquil Pond Two-handed staff strike.

He leans back to put more weight on his rearmost foot, almost crouching into a prowl. His hands come up in front of his face, the one nearer to his face balled into a fist around the middle of his staff, the other open in a knife-hand. He turns the open hand toward himself and curls his fingers in twice in a come-at-me gesture, eyeing the Law Mage with a teasing expression.

“Let us see how you do with another dance partner.”

The Law Mage is undamaged, but impressed by the cat person's moves.

Shield Guard attempts an attack at Vesra.He misses completely.

  

Garreth attempts another attack against the Lawmage, striking out with his shortsword.

Absolutely whiffing, he spins around with a body kick.

  

Vesra Annoyed the shield guard interrupts her glorious fight with Jameson, Vesra turns to him to set an example. Using the momentum she swirls her axe around her to land it into the guard. To clarify Jameson isn't forgotten and lightning jumps from her forked tail shocking him.

  

Vesra Attacks the shield guard . Versa's axe cuts through the Guard's metal shield, and lops off his arm with ease.

Shield Guard: “AAAAA”

  

'Asifa's touch sends electricity jolting through the shield guard's body again. Quickened by the flow of energy, she uses evasive maneuvers and moves to engage Jameson.

  

Asifa rushes over in a sprint, grasping at the shield guard's bicep (the forearm was cut clean off), delivering a good helping of electricity. As his body convulses from the shock, he foams at the mouth. his eyes roll to the back of his head.

  

Shield guard's life flashes before him. Never will he make amends with his Boros brother for joining the wrong guild, nor hold his niece in his arms.

  

He slumps over, lifeless. What was once a father and faithful husband, now a slab of singed meat.

  

Bogs rushes over to fill the gap formed by the death of Shield guard. He takes a guard stance against his party, eyeing Clay, down a few away from him.

  

The Law Mage's voice echoes in your mind, over and over. It's so loud you can't think. You don't feel like yourself. The only way to lessen the noise, the pain: Follow her orders.

  

Bogs Hothands “You are a threat to the Enforcer. You cannot live.”

Bogs attack the downed Clay.

  

Asifa disengages

  

Bogs inserts his rapier into the gaps of Clay's armor.

  
  

The rapier reaches deep into Clay’s insides. The pain of the open wound is nothing compared to a friend's cold steel sliding through your lungs and intestines. With his last breath, he says:

  

“All of you…D-drop your weapons in the name of the LAW!”

A gasp of air.

“Baking… is… im..urgh…haaa…”

  

Bogs grasp on reality flinches for a moment. He feels the weight of his own hands behind the blade buried deep into his new friend. A single tear falls from his face glancing off Clay’s armor. Control over his mind lapses.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Sybil sees Clay go down and turn tails to run. “I'm not dying for this....”

  

The Spear Guard prepares to dodge any attack on his next turn.

Shield Guard: “We've lost two souls to the Aether. SURRENDER.”

Sword Guard disengages from Vesra's reach and runs over to protect the Law Mage.

The Law Mage summons what appears to be a clear shield of some sort, and prepares herself from any attack.

  

Jameson disengages and retreats 15ft back, now 15ft away from Vesra, Bogs and Spear Guard. “Do you lot want more casualties? Put down your arms.”

  

Jameson lowers his guard slightly to show his readiness to end combat.

  

Pond's gaze lands on each of the guards and Jameson in turn, expression dropping into an exaggerated feline pout. He lifts out of the ready stance he was holding and adopts a more relaxed posture. “Dear officers, you are no fun. No fun at all. (to Law Mage) I was looking forward to our dance.”  
  
Pond lets out a long sigh of disappointment.

“...Very well.” 

  

His muscles are still coiled to spring if any of the guards attack an ally (ready attack action).

  

Garreth to Jameson Ebadaya

gesturing to the gathered crowd “This... outburst... has planted seeds of chaos that may grow unchecked. We will leave you to restore order here.”

  

Jameson looks over to the crowd. It's true. The chaos and blood have drawn in some less than reputables. Goblin Gangs and some Rakdos members.

  

Garreth to Jameson Ebadaya “What say you? Put this mess behind us and show this crowd a force united toward a higher purpose?”

Jameson Ebadaya does not break eye contact with the Boros Monk. He points his sword to the two dead bodies.

  

Vesra Disturbed by the death of Clay and the unforeseeable death of the one-armed shield guard, Vesra readies an attack but holds on. Her wings pulses under her heavy breathing as she waits to see how everyone reacts.

  

'Asifa Seeing several of her companions relax their stance, 'Asifa does the same, the electrical charge around her dissipating somewhat. She mutters under her breath. “Well shit. My mother always said I couldn't help but fall in with the wrong people. Well, she was right, here I go again.”

  

Bogs also lowers his guard, sensing the threat of battle dissipating.

Sybil Shadowblight Seeing everyone relax and the fighting stop, she slowly approaches again, being very cautious.

  

Garreth whispered to Jameson Ebadaya Garreth might go so far as to suggest joining forces with the guards to repress any violent outbreaks among the crowd. That would depend on how this ceasefire goes, and just how riled up the gathering mob has gotten, of course.

  

'Asifa stares into Jameson's eyes. “What now, Enforcer?”

  

Sybil Shadowblight: “Yes enforcer....what now? You killed this poor man that was traumatized by being kidnapped and made to kill his colleagues in the Gorehouse…”

  

'Asifais disgusted. “Ah yes, the Gorehouse. Did you know about that orgy of mass slaughter that seems to pass as entertainment for some very twisted people that is happening right in your precinct here?”

  

Jameson Ebadaya: “I won't trust the words of someone who murdered a fellow soldier. Wallace had a family to come home to. Two daughters and a son.”

  

Vesra “So you are saying Clay's life is less worth, if he hadn't a family?!”

'Asifa: “Murder is not something that happens in battle! We were all trying to kill each other as far as I could tell!”

  

Making no sudden movements, Pond strolls casually over to Clay's body and inspects it. He runs a hand along his whiskers. 

“A pity. He was such good entertainment value.”

  

Jameson Ebadaya: “You're right. Murder is murder. And I see 6 corroborates who assisted in killing an officer.”

  

“Hands up. You're all under arrest. You have the right to s-”

  

Law Mage: “Sir. Look.”

Jameson follows the Law Mage's gestures. The crowd has grown. The gangs and Rakdos Cult members have grown. There must be 30, 40 persons in total.

  

Goblin gangs, homeless, and society outcasts seem to edge closer and closer. 2 goblin children rush over to Clay's body and start pilfering through his backpack.

  

Spear Guard: “Back! Away, you little beasts!”

  

The moment the Spear guard gets close enough, one of the goblin children climb on his back and bury a shiv into his neck.

Spear Guard: “Agck! Gack- Hguck- wheezeeee”

  

The gangs see their chance. These soldiers are bloodied and weakened.

They rush the Azorius. 30 something humans, goblins, elves and minotaurs of lower class take what they can.

  

Pond looks about to the rest of the surviving group, smirking a little. “It seems time to take our leave. Shall we...?”

  

Jameson Ebadaya: “There's too many of them! Call for backup! RETREAT”

The crowd forms instantly between the Azorius soldiers and the party.

  

Sybil sees it. without a doubt, you see it. A feminine form in a red hood, reaching all the way to her ankles. Her eyes were pitch black as her lips moved in chanting.

She was casting a spell, invoking the crowd's bloodlust.

  

 whispered to Sybil Shadowblight

In all the chaos, you only saw the Law Mage being pushed down. The crowd is far too thick to save her from being trampled. You may receive a poisoned shiv to the neck like Spear Guard did.

Pond casually makes his way to the rest of the group, surreptitiously glancing at a certain point in the crowd. He speaks in a low tone and keeps his face impassive - luckily cat faces don't code like other humanoids. “Has anyone else noticed?”

  

You see only chaos as the many bodies rush and trample the guards.

The voices. They've returned.

5, 7 different voices telling you in different volumes, to run. Get away from here. The cacophony is too loud.

  

Then the voices stop. And in unision they say:

"Get out of the Tenth District."

  

Bogs Hothands You see a spark of blue fire shoot from the crowd.

The Law Mage's grip on your mind slips; you can feel it. With every passing second, you feel more and more like yourself.

  

When the last of the nasty spell leaves your mind, you play a cadence on your drums as a happy little celebration.

  

VesraWe need to get out of here! Fast as possible!!

  

It seems the only thing the party can do at the moment is run before the chaos intensifies.

  

Vesra

The spirits whispered to me...

Vesra looks from one of her new friends to another. One already is no more. Then she grabs something - the cut-off arm - and dives into the crowd, using her wings to fly short distances over obstacles.

  

Chaos surrounds Bogs. All noises seem to be muted and motions slowed. A goblin is yanking at his Viol, which he spent a small fortune on just the week prior. The spear guard, who left a gash on his left side, is looking back at him for a helping hand. The mage is coughing blood, with several cultists stabbing at her. Bogs throws them off, and clenches her, lifting her up to his level. Nothing seems more fitting than to end her, here and now. But he hesitates. He remembers his brothers doing the same to him many years ago. Rationality returns. He drops her back down to the ground. Bogs looks across the mayhem from his high vantage point. He gathers strength, and makes a break for it. He shoves several cultists taking a couple gashes, tripping over a small goblin, gets back up and screams...

  
  

Out of my WAYYY!

Garreth backs up against the Lawmage, looking to clear a path through the crowd.

  

Bogs takes a deep breath and expels in a cone of fire in front of him.

Bog's breath of fire sends the cultists fleeing: the lucky ones run off without their eyebrows: the worst have been disfigured for life.

A large opening forms for the party as some goblins shriek in horror as flames engulf their forms.

  

Some of the cultists are inspired. a smile forms across their faces.

  

They take out their fire breathing equipment (juggling torches and bottles of flammable fluid) and join the dragonkin in setting some unlucky viewers ablaze.

  

The fires reflect the whites of their eyes with irises of madness.

  

Garrett calls upon Aurelia for some solace amidst the Chaos. Targeting anyone outside the party or Azorius unit in a five ft. radius:

  

Before reaching safety outside of the riot, a few rioters sneak a few punches and kicks to Garreth and Bogs. Garreth's back bears a long bruise from an improvised club (table leg)

  

Fires begin to envelop the area. Cloth signs on beau's bar front are ablaze.

Tranquil Pond “Let us go, you fools! If we stay, we die.”

## Chapter 4 After the Battle

Cultists start to chant a line, further bringing madness to the streets.

  

A few memories of the gorehouse find their way into the party's thoughts.

  

Cultists: Ain't no riot like a rakdos riot!

  

Ain't no riot like a rakdos riot!

  

The party gets pretty battered, save for Asifa and Tranquil Pond, his feline reflexes like water flowing through the riot.

  

Jameson Ebadaya

“TRANSGRESSORS”

The party looks back, catching a glimpse of Jameson with his helmet off. He's a strong looking face, with 3 long scars going down his right cheek. Long black hair flows to and fro, due to the fire's draft.

  

In his gauntlet he holds a goblin's head as the goblin struggles to get free from his grasp.

With a battle yell, he crushed the goblin's head, and drops the lifeless body.

  

“I WILL find you all. You WILL be held accountable for your actions today.”

  

Pond makes shooing motions at the rest of the party as he begins to flow through the throng.

“I leave. You may all do as you wish but I strongly advise you to make haste.”

  

The screams increase with the fire's intensity. Smoke fills the air. And soon the Azorius, along with the Rakdos, are no longer visible.

  

A breather, for the moment.

The gang avoids capture, but have lost their Paladin, Clay.

  

# Chapter 5: Good Night, Paladin.

  

The fires and smoke are no longer visible as the party hides in an alley.

Soldiers from all guilds march to contain the chaos. Azorius, Boros, Selesnyans. They're all working together to calm the fires and arrest loose bands of rioters. With so much on their hands, the group is the least of their worries.

For now, the group has a bit of time to collect their thoughts and discuss the next best course of action.

  

Where do they go?

Where is safe for them to go to?

And what will they do until this all blows over?

  

The night sky is black, dotted with a few bright stars and city lights.

  

Ringing bells and riotous shouts in the distance. The sound of countless soldier boots marching in every direction as they try to maintain order. The smell of fire and fear fill the streets.

  
  

Sybil Shadowblight looks at the party, the lack of Clay's presence is obvious. What could have been a long friendship with him was cut short.

  

Behind Bogs eyes is a look of shame.

Vesra’s rage disappears and your body softens, the voices return. Though they speak all at once or out of turn, their voices are a bit more understandable this time.

  

"I'm glad you're okay"

"You should have killed that disgusting enforcer!"

"Go north, outside the district."

"Why didn't you listen to us"

"Thank the gods you're not very hurt"

  

'Asifa

You feel the key around your neck pulse weakly towards a direction.

  

Though Bogs doesn't seem himself, he reaches for his lute and tabla, and strums a quiet melody.

  

Garreth silently meditates, finding order within himself before reaching out to find it in his surroundings. Despite the day's setbacks, he feels his energy restored and his motivation stronger than ever.

  

Pond spends the quiet time sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall. One leg is stretched out long while the other is bent. He looks half-asleep but he uses the time to glance around at his new colleagues. If any look his way and meet his eyes, he holds their gaze lazily for a moment before moving on to observe another individual.

  

“Well, what an exciting time. Tell me, now that another of us has perished, what is it you all intend to do? Seek out the Gorehouse? Exact revenge on the Azorians? Go home and act like none of this ever happened? Truly, I am interested to hear your plans. Myself, I am flexible.”

  

Garreth 

The Gorehouse is a symptom, not the problem. The Azorius' behavior is arguably worse - this infection that has spread through Ravnica has reached those trusted to uphold our highest standards of honor and virtue.

We need to give Ravnica a fresh start.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

  

You see, Garreth, this is why I like you. You set goals that are realistic and achievable.

Garreth

  

 to Tranquil Pond

A mountain on its own may seem permanent and immovable, but the inexorable persistence of even the smallest river will reduce it to dust in time.

Do not be intimidated by the size of our goal, brother. Draw confidence from the strength of our conviction.

Tranquil Pond “I did not say I was intimidated. My capabilities are not at issue here.”

  

Garreth “Doubts about the practicality of a goal are often born of self-doubt.

But I am glad to hear that is not an issue for you. I have the utmost confidence in your capabilities. I could not think of a better partner to join me on this path.

I wonder, though, if our companions have learned the same lesson from our recent trials.”

  

Pond's ears flatten and his pupils enlarge as he regards the implacable human. The barest of hisses emits from his slightly open mouth before he begins grooming and preening his whiskers and face with his fingers. He assumes an exaggeratedly nonchalant tone.

“It is a pity we have not had the opportunity to test ourselves fully. However I agree that "our"... conviction is indeed very strong.”

  
  

Garreth

“Those trials will come. And it is best we seek them out before they catch us like this last encounter.

This is where our Clay's investigative talents would have helped us... We need to find a target.”

  

'Asifa holds the key, testing it.

  

Vesra 

Since the gorehouse I hear voices of the spirits very loud. So far they try to help me or us but it's new that there are so many. I don't understand that much about their reasons to engage me. I am neither smart nor wise, but I am good enough with people, so maybe I became their... what is it called? Medium?

  

“Garreth may be right, what's going on has to be changed and it looks like we were just thrown into the position to do something.”

  

“It's overwhelming at first, but every skull cracks if it were hit just often and hard enough!”

  

'Asifa

You don't have a compass, so you can't tell which way it points, it just points to your front.

  

Survival: Where's North?

  

Asifa

Rather than remember the street names, you look to the night sky and use the stars to orient yourself.

  

The key is indeed pulling you North.

  

Vesra follows half curious half worried. She takes a few steps toward the alley exit. She looks back to the group. Unsure of what to say, Vesra feels the pressure to say something nonetheless.

  

whispered to Vesra

Maybe the voices are guiding you back to your home in Precinct Five. It is, after all, North of your location.

  

The thought of inviting the 5 over to your home to rest passes your mind. Your goblin roommate wouldn't mind. This wouldn't be the first time you brought a group over for a night.

  

Pond turns his head to watch the two go. He meets the eyes of Vesra, gazing inquisitively at her as she turns back to the rest of the group, but says nothing.

  

Vesra: “You may crash at my place for now. It's not the prettiest home, but we can fit all in and we would have tap water and a nice view over the surroundings.”

  

Garreth: “Your kindness is appreciated. We will have safety in numbers during these uncertain times.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight: “Thank you, my place is much too small to accommodate everyone. And I agree, sticking together is a good idea.”

  

Asifa

“Thank you. And after we rest, we head north. Ageed?”

Garreth: “I go where you go from this point on.”

  

Vesra: “It's settled. We go.”

The party stays in the shadows, watching for Azorius as they head to Vesra's.

  

## Chapter 5 My slice of life

  

Bogs Hothands Aside from the occasional strum of Viol, Bogs has remained silent for the entirety of the walk. “Wha, are we going somewhere?”

  

Vesra: “Yeah, we are going to my home. It's way safer to discuss our further plans somewhere inside without unwanted auditory.”

“Rizzix may be there, but he isn't interested in guild politics at all.”

  

Tranquil Pond: “Nor am I, I confess. And is no one concerned about being seen traveling as a group by the Azorians? I would have thought it would be preferred to split up.”

  

Vesra leads the party through small alleys, underpasses and endless stairs. Eventually they reach precinct four, where even more stairs wait to be climbed until they reach Vesra's home on top of a tower. Vesra lets the group wait for some moments to talk with Rizzix, her roommate, and finally asks them in.

  

It's not the biggest place and far from neat, but there's enough space and seating for them all. The smell of fresh coffee fills the room and everyone can see the goblin standing on a stool in front of the kitchen counter and preparing the black beverage in a steam-powered kettle.

  

Pond's tone is more bored than worried. He lopes alongside the rest of the group following Vesra and doesn't seem to be actually suggesting they part ways.

  

Garreth to Tranquil Pond

“We should be seen. We are the harbingers of a new order. And we have strength in our unity.”

  

Pond smirks at Garreth.

“Very well. I merely wished to make the suggestion in case it had not been considered.”

Pond: “Vesra. Do you intend to make introductions, or shall I guess your friend's name?”

  

Garreth: “A wise choice to explore every alternative.”

  

Pond's ear flicks slightly at Garreth's serene attitude.

Garreth spends some time pondering Vesra's crafting table, and the various fruits of her artistic labors.

Vesra to Tranquil Pond

“Of course! I am sorry!”

  

“This is Rizzix, inventor and engineer from the Izzet guild. My friends here are Tranquil Pond, Garreth, Bogs Hothands, Asifa and Sybil Shadowblight.

Vesra points at each one as she introduces them. Rizzix nods from time to time and bows as a greeting to the group as Vesra is done.”

  

Pond holds a pawlike hand over his heart and makes a little ironic bow to the goblin.

“A pleasure.”

  

“Your hospitality is most generous.” Garreth bows deeply.

  

Rizzix jokes: No no no! The pleasure is on my side! I am always happy to see new test subj... friends of Vesra!!

  

She rarely brings anyone because she's so ugly! I am worried she'll never find a husband...

Vesra's tail emits a few sparks as she's hurt by the insult.

  

Sybil Shadowblight: “So! How did this arrangement happen? How did you both meet? An ad in the paper i presume?”

  

Vesra

“Don't tell! It's embarrassing.”

Rizzix tells anyway.

“I found her one stormy night as she tried to spend the night on the balcony when she was in her teenage years. She was clothed in tatters and soaking wet. As she noticed me she hissed at me like a stray cat (he looks at the cat person), shocked me with a lightning bolt and attacked me! Fortunately electricity is my hobby so I was wearing protective gear. I kept her to study this anomaly.”

  

As she grew older I recommended her to the Boros Legionaries due her temperament. I didn't want her to join Izzet because I had to share her with other researchers and she's too slow in thinking to become a researcher herself.

  

Now we share rent and housing.”

  

Vesra: “I am not your pet!”

Pond grins at the little fellow, crinkling his eyes. “A stray cat, you say... how interesting. And you feed her, bathe her, make sure she gets enough exercise?”

  

Rizzix: “Hahahaha, no she can care for herself, but I had to civilize her.”

  

Vesra: “Yeah because your lifestyle that nearly blows up our tower every other day is sooo civilized!”

  

As a symbol she isn't civilized yet at all, so rummages in her bag and hands Rizzix the arm of the shield guard. “Instead of bullying me in front of my friends, could you preserve this? I may need it later.”

  

Pond leans forward slightly in interest.

“Need? Whatever for?”

  

Bogs face shifts from a smirk to disgust.

Vesra: “Don't know yet. Maybe I will make a lucky charm. The spirits will tell me.”

Pond nudges Bogs a little.

  

Vesra: “Or I hand it over to the guards family when everything settled down.”

  

Tranquil Pond

 to Bogs Hothands “Come now, my friend, let us show our hosts nothing but gratitude.”

  

Rizzix hands everyone a cup with hot black coffee.

Bogs Hothands “How interesting.”

“Mmm. Thank you Rizzix. Do you use all manner of “items” in your research?

  

Rizzix: No, I am usually not interested in the materials affiliated with living beings. My research field is thermodynamics! Did you know, you can even make things as simple as wax exploding?

  

Hassling with life is something for the mediocre Simic scientists or even worse: Golgari.

Bogs Hothands “Oh right. I see. So you made her electric? We got into a little tussle back there, and couldn’t help but notice electricity emitting from her hands and, uh, tail.”

  

Rizzix: No, she was like that when I found her. It is very difficult to store electricity in things, not talking about living beings. She not only stores it, she seems to generate it! So I made an exception for her.

  

“I am waiting for the day he dissects me to find the source! Though, I told him so often I am gifted by a storm spirit.”

  

Bogs Hothands to Vesra

Does this storm spirit have something to do with the talismans that you craft?

  

Vesra

“Not only the spirits of the air! To live a safe life you have to satisfy all spirits you could encounter. When I grew up my back slowly became dark. I made a charm for a marble spirit, so he was good with me again and I could keep my angelic white for the rest of my body.”

  

Tranquil Pond: “Really”

“And so you devote your life to appeasing these spirits?”

  

Vesra shrinks.

“You are saying it as if it is something bad…”

Pond raises his paws in a disarming gesture, turning his head up and closing his eyes.

“I say nothing of the kind! I am only interested as your experience differs so vastly from my own.”

Bogs Hothands: “I've never met a spirit... Are you sure it isn't your mind playing tricks on you?”

Vesra “I am sure they guide me when they feel like it! How else would I've received my gift?”

  

'Asifa's hair swirls around her head with static, the lightning-shaped markings on her skin glowing slightly and sparks jumping between her fingertips.

  

Vesra: “And regarding being tricked: who tells you the gods you obey or the superiors you serve don't trick you? For me it's better to be tricked by the spirits of mockery or as you say, my mind, as by anyone else.”

  

'Asifa

 to Vesra

“As you can see, you are not the only one with such a... gift. I have never heard a spirit speak to me.”

  

Bogs Hothands

“Well, I guess if the thermodynamical master over here can't explain it, then I guess maybe you are in the company of such spirits.”

  

Rizzix nearly explodes in excitement seeing a second source of his interest, but Vesra cuts the words.

“I knew when I first saw you. Maybe you haven't found the right words to answer yet. Could be you spirit is shy or maybe he just wants to observe how you deal with your power.”

  

Tranquil Pond: “Well, I am no one to judge. We all walk our own paths, after all, do we not, Garreth?”

  

Bogs Hothands to 'Asifa

“So, your electricity is not bound to a spirit?”

  

'Asifa to Bogs Hothands

“I had never considered spirits, to be honest.”

to Vesra

“Perhaps you can show me how you talk to yours?”

  

Garreth

“Mmm, indeed. What truly defines one's character, though, is what happens when our paths intersect.”

  

A knock on the door.

Rizzix: Ah! More friends coming?

  

Garreth “I believe there is a natural energy that connects all things. It is curious how unique are your methods of accessing it.”

  

“We do not have many of those outside our immediate group here. It might be best not to mention we've been here.”

  

The goblin pauses to understand, but shrugs with a smile. An Izzet would know a thing or two about privacy and secrecy.

  

Rizzix stops at the door, his green hand resting over the door handle.

  

Rizzix: Who is iiiit?

  

Voice: “Rizzix, it's me. Open up, it's not safe out here. I have to share with you what's happened today.”

  

Rizzix: Oh! Okay.

  

He opens the door.

  

Your character comes in wearing common clothing

He's there to warn Rizzix, a long time friend that he's not too close with, about the Rakdos Riots earlier today.

  

He doesn't have to say anything about being Dimir or Azorius to the group right now, as he's just a worried friend. You've heard nothing about any recent wanted persons or any APB's for persons.

  

When the group mentions going north past gates and outside the city, you have connections that would let the group pass easily. So long as you do them a few favors. (quest)

  

Kail

“Rizzix, you need to pack up and.... oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were entertaining…”

Rizzix: “Kail! A surprise! come in, come, meet Vesra's friends. Some coffee for you?

The party sees entering a fairly thin man in his early thirties. Slightly shorter than average, he sports a small scar on his right cheek. He's wearing a good quality, but not fancy clothing, with high quality but clearly worn boots.

Kail

Owl familiar in the eaves of the building across the way keeping watch. Scar is fake.

  

Rizzix, the little green one is rummaging in the kitchen for more beverages to serve. A few empty tin cans are tossed, thrown about, adding to the mess of the home.

  

“Of course Rizzix, but I can't stay too long. Wouldn't recommend you do either, it's way to.. loud... outside.”

  

Rizzix walks over to a curtained window and takes a peak.

Out to the other districts, there seems to be large fires here and there, raising in intensity for a few moments.

  

Oh... what happened?

We'll be safe, no? Nothing ever happens out here in Precinct Five.

  

Kail

Oh the usual, something happened and the Rakdozian idiots are out burning the district down.

Can't see it ending well in the short term.

  

Guess there was some internal thing with the Azorians and someone got stabbed. Kicked a hornet's nest. The fires are a block or two away, but spreading quickly.

  

I'd get your important things and get out of this precinct.

Too many overreactions and you get this situation.

  

You're not too close to Rizzix. He's always assumed you're an officer of the law, but you could be Azorius, Boros, Selesnyan or Orzhov.

  

Kail

You turn to this strange gathering of people. A cat person? A child of Niv Mizzet? (Bogs) ... A Tiefling? Why is she wounded so badly? And her, she’s on fire.

  

You feel you should tell them about the situation should they have family in other precincts, and ask if they have a plan to the closest shelter.

  

'Asifa

The key tugs gently.

Vesra hears the voices again. This one voice speaks louder than the rest. You can make out that the voice belongs to a stronger man. He speaks with a gentle authority.

  

Man's voice: Hmmm. This one feels aight.

  

Garreth You see a pile of books, neatly stacked over a box of junk and scrap metal. Out of boredom, these books are attractive to inspect.

  

'Asifa takes the key in her hand. Where is it pointing now?

  

Kail

If I were all of you, I'd get you and your family out of this district

It's going to get worse before better.

  

'Asifa The key points North, still.

  

“Vesra. We still have our bearings on this key. Let us rest just a little while, for those that need it. And then we can keep moving.”

  

Kail

You're what?

  

Pond sits back with his coffee, watching the group to see whether an argument will unfold, a small smirk on his face.

'Asifa  to Kail

“Excuse me?”

  

Kail

You're bearing? You're going to go exploring in the middle of a Rakdos Riot?

  

'Asifa

“We are going north, two of us are committed to it in any case. The rest of you? Well, it's up to you.”

  

Kail is surprised.

“Really? You do know they're sealing the precinct off. The northern gates are already locked down. The Eastern were locked down first, the western are likely locked down by now too.

Well unless you have got any pull with the Boros. They're manning the gates and prepping to enter and END the riot.”

  
  
  

'Asifa

“And what are you suggesting we do? First you say we need to get out if this precinct and then you tell us we can't go out.”

Bogs Hothands “Perhaps we could convince the guards to let us through. Are any other precincts on fire? The Second?”

  

Kail

“Never said there wasn't a way out. There’s always a way.”

“Like I said you got an ‘in’ with the legion, that'd get you through”.

  

Save for Kail, the party has become irate with exhaustion. Everyone has eye bags and feels drowsy.

A few more hours awake and the party will surely feel a lasting exhaustion.

  

Pond yawns, covering his mouth with a paw. “Should we not just rest here and hope things have settled by the time we awaken? That is why we came, is it not.”

  

Kail

“Well... I might happen to know someone who could get all of you through. She'll charge tho. If it was just Rizzix, that'd be easy.”

  

Bogs Hothands yawns. “I don't know if the second is on fire, or if you all would want to cram into my basement apartment. It's also a mess. And my roommate is... Damn. Is there another place we could crash?”

  

Rizzix “Oh, no, it's fine for you all to stay! Vesra, help me get some of the bedding in my room. Wait, no, I'm using that for flammability testing, ah in the closet! We should have two or three blankets. Good for makeshift beds.”

  

“And you can tell me about your adventures! Vesra doesn't come home much with injuries like those. No, no, usually they're much, much worse.”

  

Vesra and Rizzix begin to clean up the space to accommodate the group, Rizzix assuming Kail is staying to catch up. After a good while and a few small explosions, the living room is cleaned and arranged for everyone to sleep comfortably on the couches and floor.

  

Bogs Hothands

You're very gracious Vesra and Rizzix. Thank you for accommodating so many, and without any notice. Yawn If this is our decision, I will gladly take the first sleep...

Pond settles onto the end of a couch, curling up with all four limbs retracted under his body. His blue eyes fall half-closed as he drowsily watches the rest of the group find their rest.

  

Vesra makes sure everyone is comfortable. She offers Sybil her bed a promise not to burn it, before she rests as well. Tomorrow's gonna be a hard day.

  

'Asifa removed her armor, clutches her key in her hand and tries her best to get comfortable leaning up against a corner of the room.

  

Garreth settles into a corner of the balcony, pushing off sleep for a few more hours to keep an eye and ear out for any trouble.

  

The group falls exhausted into sleep, save for Garreth. So much going on. So few people to trust.

  

It may seem paranoid, but Garreth thought it best to watch for thieves, betrayers and invaders tonight.

  

Garreth reviews the recent events in his mind. The Gorehouse, Ansem's Stare, the Azorius, finally the Riots. So much has happened in so little time. None of the law books you've studied could have ever armed you to fight with Azorius, and even kill an officer. To think you wanted to join the Azorius at some point.

  

And what of Ansem's gift? You remember his golden stare, burning deep into your eyes. Was that really a gift? It's yet to reveal itself. More likely to be a curse than anything useful.

This party seems to be of good intent. Each member is in sync with another, somehow. You feel that if you delve deeper, closer to the other members, they may give you the support to change Ravnica for the better.

  

...maybe.

  

All you know is that you thirst to spar Tranquil Pond one day. Why doesn't he stop smirking? By the gods.

  

...You miss Thanerus.

  

You won't forget how Thanerus threw you into safety: Nor how his strong, equine build was pressed between the wall and the boulder so easily. Like a clap to kill a mosquito.

## Chapter 6 Breakfast at Versa's

The sun begins to peek out from the surrounding towers.

  

Vesra leaves her room and peeks behind the window curtain. Seems the fires have stopped. Selesnyan druids and Golgari workers guide large amounts of water to extinguish the flames. What once was a city epidemic has calmed to a few smokestacks here and there.

Vesra

  

By the entrance lies Asra's sword, propped up against the wall with the other weapons. You warmly think back to your former group and the trouble you all got into.

  

...You did have a thing with Asra. A few moments of eye contact longer than they should have been. A smile or two that just seemed too friendly to come from a friend.

  

You're glad that you two met, and that you have something to remember him by.

7th Oct 2019

The group is groggy. Asifa's hair pointing in all directions, with bits of static shooting out here and there. Garreth's eyes are dark underneath them.

Vesra

7th Oct 2019

Morning.

  

So! What do you guys want to eat for breakfast? And who wants to help?

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

7th Oct 2019

Good morning. Half surprised to be alive. I have a large appetite. I myself usually eat a half dozen eggs, bread, fruit juice... So, if we need some groceries, I'll volunteer. I like fresh air in the morning anyways.

Apologetic

Garreth, sheesh. Have you been awake all night?

7th Oct 2019

Eggs? Bacon? errrr... (looks at Pond) Tuna with a side of milk?

Pond stretches thoroughly, first elongating his arms and arching his back, then pointing his toes and allowing his leg muscles quiver back into wakefulness. His ears swivel at the unfamiliar sounds of the busy dwelling.

Sleepy

Breakfast would be most welcome.

He makes no move to get up from his couch.

 to Bogs Hothands

Come on, I need to stretch my legs. Let's go get some food.

Vesra

7th Oct 2019

You look into your fridge.

  

Most of the food and ingredients are rotten. There's just enough fresh food for one person.

  

You opt to make everyone just enough to share.

  

The pans and utensils are your friend today. The cosmos align the eggs amd the pepper: the juice and the cup.

  

You make enough for a small snack for everyone, beating the eggs with such force that it comes out fluffy, delicious, and surprisingly filling.

  

Briefly, you contemplate entering the cuisine industry.

Sybil Shadowblight

Impressed

7th Oct 2019

Vethra, oh my goths (mouth full of eggs)

Ith's tho gooth. Hot, hot, hot

You've had eggs before, but never with the technique Vesra had applied this day.

  

The party surrounds you. They know they must stop you before you finish the meal yourself.

Playful

Back off! These eggs are mine! Hahahaha!

7th Oct 2019

It seems Sybil won't share. At least... not without a fight.

7th Oct 2019

Willing party members begin to prepare to explore their surroundings for food

'Asifa

7th Oct 2019

Bogs and 'Asifa descend the tower and check things out. Not being very familiar with the area, they look around for some groceries while keeping an eye out for trouble.

Sybil Shadowblight

7th Oct 2019

Sybil calms down and eats the rest of the eggs at the table.

Embarrassed

You guys are no fun...

'Asifa

7th Oct 2019

Emerging from the apartment entrance, you and Bogs look around, expecting to see the remnants of Rakdos carnage.

Garreth

7th Oct 2019

Garreth ventures out with them, somewhat groggily though ever determined.

7th Oct 2019

The two see Garreth and walk slow enough for him to catch up

The streets seem... normal. It doesn't seem that the riots reached out to this precinct. Boros soldiers pass by, without so much as a glance to the current party.

Precinct Five. The home of the studious and the curious. In this Precinct you'll find academies, libraries, and inventing workshops.

  

You look about and see varying races and guild members with books in hand, or a large mechanism of some type shooting smoke and/or electrical discharging.

As all three of you sit by a calming water fountain, these are what you see:

  

-Qal's Discount Books and Tomes

  

-The Yellow Thirst-beak

  

-Antiques and Trinkets

  

-Noble Raven Used Books and Rentals

  

-Quilliam Academic Supply

  

-Bowls of Gruul (And Selesyan Salads)

Points of Interests that you see nearby:

  

-A young merchant selling bread and veggies from a cart

  

-A coffeeshop cart

  

-A crowd surrounding what seems to be musicians

Garreth

7th Oct 2019

Garreth will make his way towards the crowd, attempting to pick up any threads of rumors/talk of the town.

7th Oct 2019

7th Oct 2019

Citizen with Hat: Did you hear about what happened in Tin Street, in front of Beau's?

  

Female Citizen: I heard! Something about a Boros Soldier and Azorius Arrester, right?

  

Citizen with Hat: It was a Selesnyan Soldier and an Azorius.

  

Female Citizen: You sure?

  

Citizen with Hat: I'm sure! Anyway, I can't believe it. Over a salad?

  

Female Citizen: You're telling me those riots last night was over a salad?

  

Citizen: There was talk about a cat... and a lizard. Spilled milk, maybe?

  

Female Citizen: You can't be serious.

Garreth

7th Oct 2019

Garreth returns to his companions and explains that the spread of rumors may have provided some anonymity.

Bogs Hothands

Cheerful

8th Oct 2019

If I wasn’t in the company you fine folks, I would hammer out a sweet jam session with those performers over there. But we’re here to eat, so I’d say bowls of gruul sounds like the hot ticket right about now.

Before awaiting a response Bogs makes his way toward the establishment.

'Asifa

  

'Asifa follows Bogs, curious about what is in a bowl of gruul.

Bogs Hothands

Worried

  

 to Garreth

Pond and I should travel together carefully. It seems that a lizard and cat are sticking points to the rumors.

 to 'Asifa

Curious

Is that the key that Ansem gave you? It seems you really like it. You hold it as if it is dear to you.

'Asifa

  

'Asifa quickly outs away the key she was fondling. She looks away from Bogs but then turns half way back to him.

 to Bogs Hothands

Pensive

It may be nothing good. But it may also be the only useful lead I've ever found to figuring out what I am.

'Asifa

Friendly

  

 to Bogs Hothands

Come on then. Let's pick up this food and get back. Time for me to find what this key is pointing to.

  

The group walks into Bowl of Gruul

“AAAAAAAAAAAH”

  

Immediately the group draws their weapons. They're met by a man dressed in... leather and bone? He's behind the counter a good 30ft away, chopping away at a boar with a butcher knife.

System

  

Butcher: Welcome, welcome!

The battle scream came from the butcher, it seems. The party sheathes their weapons.

  

Bogs thinks of the situation he’s joined.

The Gruul are a savage people, living off the ruins of Ravnica and spending their time breaking down manmade structures and buildings. They're people who've fought all their lives.

It's a surprise to see a Gruul Human male behind a counter...working, rather than wrecking the shop and beating you for living in society rather than the wilds.

  

'Asifa takes one look at the butcher and Asifa loses her appetite.

Aahhh, where are the salads?

  

Bogs Hothands

As long as it doesn't make a cannibal out of me, I'll have a large bowl of gruel please.

  

Garreth

We should pop into the tavern before heading back. Barkeeps often have more reliable information than crowds of commoners.

  

The party grabs enough for seven people to go. 3 Bowls of Gruel (It's actually more than just wheat) and a large salad of greens, tomatoes and other such salad makings.

Asifa slips 2 silvers to the butcher. A very pretty female human dressed in Selesnyan Garb pops up from behind him. Using mage hands, she assembles the order and packages it all nicely in a large paper bag (with handles)

  

Garreth

With a dulled disposition, you lead the group into The Yellow Thirst-Beak, just a few hundred feet (90ish meters) from the Gruul/Selesnyan Restaurant.

  

... The Yellow Thirst-Beak is not what you imagined. The interior is brightly illuminated by dancing lights that move ever so slowly around the area. The barkeep leans across the bar, staring into a group of young students in the corner of the room. The gentle sound of lute strings fills the air.

  

Bogs Hothands

Well Garreth, my friend, I don’t want our food to go cold. Let’s see what the bartender knows and move on. Hello there mister. Could I get an orange juice to go? It’s good to see things have quieted down this morning. Did you hear what happened that started the riots last night?

  

Bartender: Oh, yes. The riots. Seems a ragtag group of persons attacked a well known Azorius enforcer on his break. A few casualties. It all happened so fast, no one managed to get a good look at the attackers except for some of the gangs.

  

They say it's a group of people, about 8 or so. Keep an eye for them; I hear the Azorius pay handsomely for fugitives. Anything else?

Bogs Hothands

Hmm. I guess we all hear different things. Also, it seems the cult has become more brazen the last couple weeks. Have you heard of a man named Ansem? He may be related to the Cult of Rakdos and the Gore House.

  

Bartender: Ansem, ansem... sounds familiar. You'd have to ask a Rakdos cultist about that.

  

'Asifa

Brilliant. Thanks for the advice. Let's get back to the others.

  

The group heads back.

  

Once back at Vesra's, they find that Kail has joined them once again, talking to Rizzix about possible move, somewhere cheaper.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Guys, listen, i've given it some thought, and I think it's best if I take a breather for a bit.

Watching my party die, escaping arrest... it's a but much. I'm gonna go home.

  

Come find me in a few weeks time if you need me.

You take off Ansem's ring and hold it out.

Does anyone need this? You might need it more than me.

  

Bogs Hothands

I totally understand Sybil. To be honest, I haven't felt right either. Be careful out there. It sounds like rumors are ambiguous about who was involved, but the Azorius guard has a price on all of our heads. I'm sure one of us could make good use of your ring. It certainly wouldn't fit on my sausage fingers.

  
  

Pond's ear turns in the direction of Bogs and Sybil.

Did the fellow tell you anything about what it does?

  

Sybil Shadowblight

She places the ring on the coffee table in front of the couches and packs her things.

You don't remember? It's a ring of insight. It tells you the true intentions of anyone you touch.

So far, we haven't had a reason to use it. So...

  

Tranquil Pond

Of course I remember.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

Someone should try it on. See if it fits.

 to Garreth

Ansem also did something with your sight. Right? Maybe you can get away with 2 boons.

  

Pond glances to Garreth and speaks up quickly.

I would like to try it on.

  

You pick the ring up and examine it in your paw.

The ring is copper gold, with an inset jewel that continues to shift in color.

  

There is writing on the inside of the ring in common:

  

"To Sybil; with love." -(foreign writing)

The ring is pleasantly warm.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond tries to slip the ring around his smallest finger.

  

The moment Tranquil Pond places the ring around his finger, he enters a vision.

Pond is surrounded in immense heat. Screams fill his keen ears.

He is in a burning building. No. A cafe. All around him are humanoids chained to their metal seats. Their clothes torn and burned, revealing melted flesh and bone. Red, winged daemons come and serve these 'patrons' coffee and cake.

  

Ansem

No, no, no, my friend.

  

Ansem sits across from you, his legs crossed as he enjoys his tea in a beautiful ceramic tea set.

He takes a sip. Then shoots you a smile, his eyes glowing gold.

  

Ansem

You've had your gift. Don't be greedy now.

Do remember to call me in your time of need.

  

Tranquil Pond

You return to the present, the ring glows red hot as the fur around your smallest finger singes.

  

Pond quickly removes the ring and sets it back on the table with a little shocked hiss.

It, ah, does not fit.

  

Sybil Shadowblight

(notices the line of smoke from Pond's finger) what happened? You zoned out for a quick second.

  

The ring sits on the table, it's regular copper gold color returned.

  

Pond's face goes flat and expressionless, quite unlike his usual sly manner.

“Nothing. It simply does not fit.”

  

Sybil Shadowblight

...got it.

I think i'll take it back.

  

With her things packed, she grabs the ring from the table and slips it on her finger.

  

Sybil examines the gem in a sunlight beam.

Hmph. Pretty.

I'm off. Find me at 385 Alagastal Way. Know what, here;

She writes her address on a slip of paper and leaves it on the coffee table.

A few handshakes for the men, a hug for the girls.

  

...please be safe, guys.

She closes the entrance door, to be seen again some other day.

  

Hey, before you go, can you tell me where I messed up in general?

  

Pond glances wryly at the door and back at his companions.

Well, then there were five. And Kail .

  

Bogs Hothands

to Tranquil Pond

I should tell you that some rumors included a cat and lizard. We should probably leave a gap between us while in public.

  

Tranquil Pond

Are you ashamed of our love, darling?

  

Bogs Hothands

Alright alright. Have it your way. Just let me win a few hands at blackjack when we are cell mates.

  

Pond smirks.

No, no, you are probably right. Just know our bond cannot be broken by mere distance.

  

Bogs Hothands

 to Tranquil Pond

Sure sure. pat pat on his head, as if he was a cat.

Eyes squinting, Pond gives an involuntary purr. His playful expression returns as he cracks an eyelid to regard Bogs.

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs looks over at Garreth, and then back at Pond.

to Tranquil Pond

Are you sure you’re a monk?

  

Tranquil Pond

I choose not to use such mundane labels.

  

Bogs Hothands

 to 'Asifa

What is the plan?Didn’t you say we should head north earlier?

  

The key around Asifa's neck gently tugs to North.

  

'Asifa

Yes. And if you are quite done eating your breakfast, I'd soon be off. The rest of you coming?

  

A grin from Pond.

But of course. This group is nothing but entertainment.

  

Bogs Hothands

I’m satiated. I may have to keep Bowls of Gruul on my radar. I’d give them four stars.

  

Pond gathers up his few things, tucking the smaller items into his sleeves. He leans his staff on his shoulder and waits for the others to be ready.

Bogs Hothands

Baffled

9th Oct 2019

 to 'Asifa

If you don’t mind me asking, why are we heading north?

Garreth

9th Oct 2019

Garreth pours himself a cup of coffee for the road and ventures out with the group.

'Asifa

10th Oct 2019

'Asifa pulls out her key to check if it's still pointing north.

 to Vesra

, last word from your spirits is north?

10th Oct 2019

Asifa shows Rizzix the key, and its strange orientation whenever she holds it.

  

Rizzix listens as the group elaborates on the Gorehouse, Ansem, the rise in Rakdos activity, and how the key could lead to great treasure.

  
Upon mention of Treasure, Kail offers his services. A percentage of the treasures they find, wherever this key may lead.

Before they leave, Rizzix slips Vesra a few bottles of what seems to be a swirling firestorm in a glass flask.

  

"My recreation attempt at Alchemist's Fire", Rizzix smiles mischievously.

  

"It may prove useful... or useless. Let me know how they turn out when you return."

[Obtained 3 bottles of Rizzix Alchemist Fire Prototype]

Asifa and Kail take lead. With Tin Street blocked off and law officers on guard, the party opt to go around. South, east, then northeast.

  

Through precinct six, then precinct four. Ride a few trams along the way. It should be smooth sailing to the North Bridge once they reach the transguild promenade.

  
  
  

The party sees wanted posters of themselves in some walls. But they're exaggerated caricatures at best.

  

Still, precautions should be taken. Wanted alive, each party member holds an 80 gold bounty.

  

The party uses hoods and cloaks to hide their faces along transit.

  

After 4 hours of transit, the party finally arrives at the northmost protected of Precinct Four.

  

The tram arrives in a suspicious area. It feels lawless. Crude symbols are poorly painted along structure walls.

  

Gangs of 4 or more humanoids openly carry their unsheathed weapons as they stare down Boros Soldiers patrolling.

  

Of which there must be a total of 20 soldiers around. Some are wounded, all seem ready for war.

There are many shady looking shops and bars all around. Prostitutes of all shapes and sizes lurk the alleys, whistling and beckoning anyone that passes by.

Tranquil Pond

  

Pond reaches out and runs a finger along the jawline of one of the sex workers, before carrying on as if it had never happened.

'Asifa

  

Your key tugs at you stronger, now. Holding it out, it points straight at a Boros Checkpoint.

  

Past the checkpoint, you can plainly see the Red Wastes: the long abandoned and overgrown structured destroyed by the many Gruul Clans.

  

You look to your group. You know it in confidence that the key leads to something of great use. Here's hoping that nothing of significance is lost along the way.

  

# Chapter 5.5: During the Rakdos Riots

  

Folin, a dwarf ranger and the youngest son of an artisan jewel maker that is send out in to the world to find rare and valuable gems.

  

Isaac, a human cleric who devoted his life to study Mystra, the Goddess of magic, in hope to some day learn how to become a powerful wizard.

  

Bartok, a human druid who, in his exile, discovered a horrible secret that could change the fate of the world.

  

Groto the Great, a thiefling warlock that made a pact with a fiend to become the best magician and illusionist the world had ever seen.

  

Tool, a half-orc paladin that wants the make the world a better place by spreading love, peace and happiness.

  
  

---

  

Your lungs feel like they're about to collapse. Running. Running. All you've been doing is running. When can the group stop?

  

It was supposed to be an easy score. Find evidence of carnage and torture in one of the Cult's 'pop-up' events. Show it to the Boros Officer for a handsome reward. In and out.

  

But you all got caught. Tin Street seemed like the perfect place to lose the pursuers, but there was some sort of giant dispute going on.

  

Now you and the other 4 are running for your lives.

  

Tool

Panting

Can we...ha... slow down...ha... this armor's not light.

  

Groto

Desperate

We can't! Those red freaks are right behind us!

Laughs, screams, and countless footsteps behind you. A moment ago you looked back: it was 6 cultists chasing after your party. A quick glance back and the count increased to 15. They're gaining in number.

Bartok

Anxious

  

Take this left!

The party turns left.

  

Dead End.

Bartok

Disappointed

Oh, no.

Folin

Alarmed

They're coming! Move!

  

At the very edges of the dead end is a small gap just big enough to fit a person or two.

Smaller party members fit with no trouble. Groto scratches horns along the brick walls.

  

Tool struggles to fit. It's not good. In desperation, Tool's wedged in the gap.

Tool

Desperate

No,no, NO! Isaac! Folin! Please!

  

The gap is so small, not even the dwarf can turn around. Then entire party moves along, forced to listen to the screams of their paladin echoing off the walls.

  

Bartok

Angry

This is so messed up. But we can't turn back!

  

The group passes the thin alleyway with minor scrapes. Avoiding the sounds of marching, screams, and terrible laughter, the group find themselves up a flight of stairs atop a structure.

  

Commanding Voice:

HALT.

  

The four turn around and stare at a group of 6 Boros Soldiers, armed from head to toe in plate mail, wielding tower shields and spears.

  

Angry

You Rakdos filth have lived long enough. You will pay for starting this bloodshed.

Isaac

Baffled

  

No, we're no-

  

SILENCE! Your blood soaked clothes speak for themselves.

  

Looking down on themselves and each other, the party is noticeably covered in red.

Bartok

Baffled

  

Wait, but we were never even close to-

Bartok sees a group of cultists across the rooftop about 40 feet away. As they laugh maniacally and point at the party, one of them is in a trance. His eyes are solid black as he gestures with his hands. They're just out of the Boros Soldier's peripheral vision.

  

Baffled

...This blood? It's not real. Just look behind you, you'll see tha-

  

Boros Battlemage: Oldest trick in the book.

  

The Battlemage begins to whisper to himself. His hands light up with a red aura. In front of the soldiers forms 1, 2, 4, countless swords made of red mana.

  

They begin to spin erratically, forming a wall of spinning swords. The wall begins to move at a crawling pace, picking up speed as it heads straight to the party.

  

With no other way to safety, the group steps to the very edge of the rooftop, the wall of spinning blades close in.

  

No other way.

  

With a nod to each other, the party jumps.

  

The party lands on a collection of thin water and mana pipes connected from building to building. They bend under the immense weight of the group. Water shoots out from some of the piping connections.

  

In the jump, Isaac rolls off to the side, hanging on to a pipe, hanging on to life.

  

Groto

Isaac, hold on!

  

Groto unsteadily goes to help Isaac to safety.

Twip

Twip

Twip

Crossbow bolts pierces through Isaac's arm and torso.

  

Groto looks up to see the Cultists on the other rooftop, laughing and cheering. They shake their crossbows over their heads in pride.

Isaac's body drops down what looks like 80 feet (24m) into a refuse pile along the alley below. Blood pools around the punctured body.

Bartok

Desperate

Groto, get up! We gotta go!

Still in shock, Groto is dragged along the thin pipes. Bartok, Groto and Folin force their way through poorly locked doors, down a staircase back to the ground floor.

  

All around them is pandemonium. Radkos Cultmembers in read and black leathers, attacking anything that moves. Citizens flee to safety, barring the doors of shops and buildings to keep them from the Rakdos (and other, less fortunate citizens).

  

Soldiers in Red, Soldiers in Blue, Dryads fighting Daemons as they start and quench the flames all around. Chaos in the streets. You have no idea where to go.

  

Citizens! Get behind me! The Azorius protects!

  

An Azorius man with a glowing blue sword slashes at cultists and raiders taking advantage of the pandemonium.

  

The man has 3 long scars going down his right cheek. his long, black hair flows to and fro, due to the many fire's draft. His plated armor is coated with thin lines of dried blood, seeming to originate from the dent in his chestplate.

  

Behind him are 2 wide-eyed citizens.

There's too much going on. The party sticks to the walls, looking to the area that has less activity, more safety.

The sound of hooves clattering along cobblestone. Closer, closer.

  

Bartok turns to the source.

A centaur in Gruul clothing strides past, slightly off balance by the stone warhammer they wield. The stone hammerhead is covered in blood.

  

Folin turns to Bartok, whose body lays flat on the ground, twitching in pain, a blood pool underneath.

  

Centaur Gruul: We're late to the party, so we're catching up! Enjoy the party favor! HAHAHA

Folin grabs Grotto without a word and makes a run headed North, hugging the walls.

  

Groto

Folin, stop! We have to wait for Barto-

  

Folin

BARTOK'S DEAD, GROTO. DON'T LOOK BACK

12th Oct 2019

The pair find momentary safety in a cluster of citizens. Soldiers of different colors are guiding them down to a shelter in the undercity.

  

The adrenaline begins to fade as the two walk through the stairs leading down. The laughing, screaming, begin to die down until only the whispering murmurs of citizens can be heard.

  

Groto

Hey Folin, think we can find any rare gems down here?

Folin

Folin wordlessly follows the line of people, Folin's stare a thousand yards away.

  

Groto

...

  

Selesnyan Rangers in green cloaks guide Tenth District Citizens down, down, further down into the undercity. Finally the rangers lead the 40 or so citizens into a spacious, well lit room of sorts.

  

The room is filled with wooden crates of shapes and sizes: dusty furniture stacked along the walls.

  

With a little bit of help, the rangers make enough accommodations for their wards.

  

Selesnyan Ranger: Listen up! We'll hold out here until we get the okay from the officers upstairs.

  

We don't know how long this will go for. Rest assured that as long as you stay with a ranger, you'll be fine.

  

Now; is anyone wounded? We have medical supplies and some magic spells to help with injuries.

  

A moment to breathe. Although everyone is still cautious, the tension in the air lessens.

  

A large orzhov man, wearing expensive clothing spun from gold fabrics, passes Folin and the crowd by.

  

Folin looks at the man. His white golden white robe is bloodied. But... something feels off.

  

Folin

...Groto, come with me.

  

The Orzhov man approaches the rangers. They're at the center of the room, tending to the wounded. He pushes his hat forward to hide his eyes and brushes his moustache with two fingers.

Well now! This is ridiculous! Quite the audacity of you Selesnyans!

The rangers turn to the loud man. The Orzhov man has everyone's attention as they stare at him. Those behind him notice the blood marks on his back.

  

Groto

Hey, where are we going? We just got here.

  

Folin

Something's not right with that man. He's wounded.

  

Groto

Well, yeah, half the people here were injured, you didn't see the riot we just came from?

  

Selesyan Ranger: Uhh, sir, If you're wounded, you can wait in line, there's quite the amount of injured, you s-

  

Orzhov Man: No, no, no, this will not stand! As you see, I am an Orzhov Guildsman! Far more important than this drivel around me! You will tend to my wounds at once!

  

Folin

Folin leads Groto to the entrance where the rangers led them in. He hands Groto a small burlap sack. From the sound of it, it's filled with a good amount of coin and something else.

  

Groto

I took this from the job. It was sitting on the table, I just had to.

Tell my family I love 'em, okay? I left something in there to remember us by.

  

Selesyan Ranger: Sir, there is protocol that we follow, just line up and we will-

  
  

Orzhov Man: I am not a comedian, Ranger! Do you -pfft- HAHA ahem Do you -pfft- HAHAHAHA

  

The entire room looks at each other confused.

The Orzhov man continues to laugh with a psychopathic look in his eye.

  

He tears open his Orzhov clothes and lets the bloodied rags drop to the floor. All across his body in varying sizes is the Rakdos Symbol, branded into him. Some brands were multiple attempts, and some brands are infected with necrotic flesh. On back are magic summoning circles, cut into him. They begin to glow a painful red.

  

Orzhov Man: ...Do you think this is a joke? heheheheHaHaHaHaHAHAHAHA

He begins to foam at the mouth, shaking in pain. Something beneath his skin starts to move. The way it moves; it's like something in him is trying to get out.

Selesyan Ranger: EVERYBODY GET BACK HE'S SUMMONING

The crowd flees in terror, hugging the walls.

The man swells in size, getting as round as a bubble. Bigger and bigger he gets, his expanding skin swallowing his legs and arms.

  

Folin pulls open the door.

Groto, you gotta go.

  

Groto

Why does this sound like goodbye? Come on, let's-

  

Folin

I've seen this before. We can't escape all of them. One of use has to stay, so the other can make it.

  

Groto

Wait, all of them? What do yo-

  

Orzhov Man: Get ready for the pu-

The man explodes, releasing a torrent of blood. The screams echo off the stone walls.

...In the blood, thousands upon thousands of leech-like creatures about 6 inches (15 CM) long.

A cacophony of odd sounds fill the room, as the leech creatures spread their bat-like wings and begin to fly in every direction.

  

Folin

GO

  

Folin pushes Groto out, just before the torrent of blood reaches the entrance. The Dwarf shuts the door. a click can be heard.

  

Groto gets up and violently bangs on the door.

Folin, NO! no, no, no. This can't be happening! Isaac, Bartok, no, no, NO

  
  

Folin's voice can be heard through the door.

Get to safety, Groto! It's only a ma-

Folin's voice suddenly stops. Slowly the screams disappear one by one.

  

Groto stops banging. It's too late.

  

Can't go up. The Riots. Can't stay. whatever's behind that door will get through. Maybe. Can't risk it.

With a heavy burlap sack and a heavier conscience, Groto runs through the undercity. Distant yelling and footsteps can be heard, echoing off the maze of tunnels.

  

.

...

...

...

...

...

Groto has been walking nonstop for what has felt like hours, jumping at the slightest moves and noises.

  

A turn around the corner. Finally, a beam of sunlight. People chattering about.

  

Groto takes the staircase up.

  

Boros soldiers keep a viligant watch as gangs openly wield their weapons in hand. Merchants argue and throw rocks at young hoodlums trying to take wares off their stalls.

Precinct Four. An area close to the Northern Gate.

  

Groto

Whatever's in the bag that Folin gave you, it's starting to pull. It's strong.

  

You resist its pull, but it's like wrestling a Minotaur. Your feet leave two lines in the ground as you resist the bag's pull. Passerbys watch you at a distance, not wanting to get involved.

The pull proves too strong. You are dragged face first into the ground as you hand on. If this bag disappears, so will the gold and whatever Folin left you. You hang on for dear life.

The bag stops pulling, shortly after you fall over someone.

  

Voice: Hey, what are you think you're doing!?

You get up, holding the burlap sack.

  

Seems you've bumped into quite the odd group. A Dragonborn, A Tiefling, Combine Scientists, etc.

  

The pull is gone. You untie the bag, fishing for whatever was giving you a hard time.

In your hand, a copper key tied with black twine to a wooden box about the size of a small, thick book.

  

It pulls slightly towards the silver key around the beautiful, white haired girl you bumped into.

  

Beautiful White Haired Girl: That key... who are you?

  

Groto

You just lost every single member of your group on a mission gone wrong. Exhausted. Drained. Stressed. Whatever Folin took, it's led you to this party, this moment.

  

Do you report back to the Boros? Mourn the death of your friends? Rest a while at a nearby inn, or question this lot about the significant of the keys?

  

All you know is that you're tired. So, so tired.

  

However you solve your problems will have unforeseen consequences.

How you conduct yourself from this point on is up to you.

# Chapter 6: A Tiefling Addition

'Asifa looks down at her key and then into the eyes of the one who bumped into her. Static electricity sparks as they collide.

  

I said who in the hell are you?!

  

Groto

Before the group stands a young, male thiefling dressed in leather armor and a long, black cloak outlined with a patern of purple and silver stars. He has two small horns, slick black hair, a thin mustache and a goatee. You can see he has a large leather book on a chain attached to his sash as well as four daggers.

His skin is of a red orange complexion. Somewhat like the color of raw salmon.

  

I'm someone who did not enjoy the last couple of hours...

Got any booze?

He gives a weak and tired smile.

  

Tranquil Pond

The tabaxi steps forward to stand to the side of the white-haired woman, regarding the tiefling before them. He stands just over six feet, with smooth fur and a dark brown face fading into almost a cream colour on the back of his head and his neck. His features are patrician, the nose and ears prominent, and his eyes are a striking blue. He wears a blue open vest which comes to mid-thigh over baggy grey trousers which tighten at the upper calf. His bare feet and hands match the dark brown of his face, ears, and waving tail. He carries a long wood staff with metal caps at either end slung casually over his shoulder.

  

Liquor? I fear not, my ragged friend. Come, 'Asifa, do not be aggressive with our... guest. He appears to be what you have been drawn to.

  

Tranquil Pond

  

The feline face nods to the keys in both their hands.

Groto

  

Groto looks at the keys.

  

Okay...this is weird. Even for me...

  

Who are you guys?

Garreth

These are troubling times, traveler. "Weird" has little to do with it.

  

Tranquil Pond

Oh, yes, my colleague will tell you all about how these are times of unconscionable corruption that must be brought down.

  

Garreth

  

A different flavor of monk emerges from behind the tabaxi. He is very bald, stern, and moves with absolute confidence. He wears Boros colors, and speaks in even, placid tones.

  

Groto

 to Tranquil Pond

The tiefling can see as much for himself, I'm sure. Turning to Groto Our lot was brought together in the fires of a Rakdos gauntlet. What transpired to bring your path across ours?

  

Groto

Tense

It...it was a mission gone wrong. I just lost four comrades. I'm a bit shaken up to be honest.

  

Tranquil Pond

That is a very telling question. Who are we, indeed?

  

Garreth

Each of us is the last of five. We are a band of survivors, united by both tragedy and perseverance.

  

Tranquil Pond

... And by stupid luck.

Garreth

Luck is simply a matter of perception.

  

Tranquil Pond

Yes, and if I am lucky I see and hear more than you do.

  

Pond: So, survivor, what do you bring to this group?

  

Groto

Detached

I was lucky I had a friend that saved my ass.

  

Groto speaks in a small voice:

Sad

Folin, you stupid dwarf...

  

Garreth

Stupid? No. He saw in you what we all do. You have what it takes to set things right.

  

Tranquil Pond

Perhaps be grateful, little tiefling. It might have been you instead.

  

Bogs Hothands

Pond, what are you toying with now? Did you finally catch a mouse?

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond turns his head to smirk at Bogs, eyes sliding toward the newcomer. He tilts his head in a curious manner.

Playful

You might say so, darling. But this mouse has not yet demonstrated whether or not he will be delicious.

Bogs Hothands

13th Oct 2019

Emerging from behind and above his companions is a large male Dragonborn, standing nearly 7 feet tall. His small scales are rust colored. Instruments adorn his front, side and rear. A large metal drum, or shield thing, he carries regularly, of which he has been hammering on, to the annoyance of anyone nearby.

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

13th Oct 2019

 to Groto

Hello there. You look frightened. Perhaps I can calm your nerves with a little diddy. as he continues, he strums a light and soothing tune on his lute This is Tranquil Pond. He won’t really eat you. That’s Garreth, the serious one. I’m Bogs, this is Asifa, who guides us with a key, and there’s a couple more of us in our uh.. group. They are mingling about.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

  

I have not yet said I will not eat him. You do not know what I am capable of.

Bogs Hothands

Curious

  

 to Groto

Oh you have a key as well.... Ahaa. Yes, the gears are turning now. Say, where did you get that key?

Groto

Tired

  

It was the last thing my stupid dwarf friend gave me before he pushed me out the door and got himslef killed.

It's what led me to you...

Groto starts patting his coat, like he is looking for something.

Relieved

Ah, there you are. Sorry buddy, totaly forgot about you for a second. Come out and say hi.

A small, brown, weasel comes crawling out one of the coat sleeves.

Affectionate

This is Howard. My partner in crime.

Detached

Yeah...the only partner I have left it seems.

Howard climbes up the coat to Groto's shoulder and gives a little squick.

Serious

So. Whats up with those keys?

'Asifa

Serious

  

All I know is I've decided to follow where mine is pointing. When in doubt, do something. And that's what I'm doing. My associates here are coming along. Vesna there has her own reason to head the same way.

'Asifa holds her key and motions to the newcomer to do the same.

Groto

  

Groto gives her a questioning look and holds his key in front of him.

Vesra

Pensive

  

Asifa was gifted this key when we met a rather untrustworthy person. However the spirits tell me to go there, too. So we go there. I don`t think it`s coincidence we met here.

Groto

Confused

  

I guess not. But why? Why is this happening?

And what do we do now we met?

Vesra

  

Someone said something about the guild pact being not stable. I don`t know a lot about it, but it may Ravnica itself which demands our help.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

  

Lofty goals, all, I grant you. I am here to watch and be entertained. So far this lot has not disappointed.

Vesra

  

Vesra checks our the fellow Tiefling and his hairy little friend. He seems to be determined by the same destiny regarding the circumstances they met.

Groto

Sarcastic

13th Oct 2019

Glad someone is enjoying this.

Tranquil Pond

13th Oct 2019

Pond spreads his long arms.

Amused

I see no utility in dwelling on the past. And surely your dwarf would not wish you to suffer.

Garreth

13th Oct 2019

Tranquil Pond has the right of it. You may learn from past experience, yes, but do not be mired down by what has already transpired.

Tranquil Pond

13th Oct 2019

The feline head nods as though Pond has said something profound and sagacious.

Bogs Hothands

Curious

13th Oct 2019

 to Groto

you don’t happen to play any instruments do you?

13th Oct 2019

Asifa, curious to the keys' nature, holds her silver key to Groto's. Groto reciprocates.

  

As the copper and silver key approach each other, they shake violently.

  

ting

  

Once the keys touch, the black threads of each key release from Groto and Asifa's neck. They braid into one another, forming a thicker thread.

  

The two keys now hang from the same thread, side by side on the dusty floor.

Groto

Admiring

13th Oct 2019

Thats pretty impressive to be honest.

Groto

Admiring

13th Oct 2019

 to Bogs Hothands

No, sorry. I lack any musical skills.

Tranquil Pond

13th Oct 2019

Pond leans down to inspect the two keys.

Curious

I wonder where might be found the door which is opened by these two keys. Are there more? Who can say?

Garreth

13th Oct 2019

Perhaps in the Red Wastes? The key seemed intent on pulling us out beyond the city limits.

And if that is the case, I suggest we take a moment to resupply.

Garreth moves towards the nearest row of shopping stalls, hoping to acquire the items on his list.

Groto

Tired

13th Oct 2019

And get a drink. Or two. Or more...

Garreth

13th Oct 2019

 to Groto

Rest may also help. It would be best to move forward with clear senses.

Garreth's own exhaustion nags at him as he searches for his desired wares.

Tranquil Pond

Mocking

13th Oct 2019

 to Garreth

Did we not just...? Oh, that's right, some of us insisted on staying awake all night.

Garreth

13th Oct 2019

I will admit, the hours escaped me.

Tranquil Pond

Detached

13th Oct 2019

In any event, I too have need of an item or two.

Groto

Annoyed

13th Oct 2019

I feel like a drink would be very appropriate for this situation.

Tense

But sleeping would be an excelent idea too.

Tranquil Pond

14th Oct 2019

Pond shrugs, eyes closing briefly.

Detached

You are most welcome to seek a drink or rest, newcomer. It is the choice of 'Asifa when the Quest of the Key - Keys, now, I suppose - continues.

Groto

Apologetic

14th Oct 2019

 to Tranquil Pond

I'm sorry, I'm just having a rough night. I'm glad I found you people but this is just a bit much for me right now.

Howard curls up in Groto's neck, making small rodent like noises. Almost like a spinning cat.

Affectionate

I will be alright buddy. Thanks.

Groto gently scratsches Howard little head.

Tranquil Pond

14th Oct 2019

Pond speaks again as he turns to move a little away from the tiefling.

 to Groto

Amused

Your apology is superfluous, keeper of Howard. It is already forgotten.

So. To an inn or the shops?

Groto

14th Oct 2019

I'm not relay feeling like shopping. Just point me to an inn and I will wait for you there.

'Asifa

14th Oct 2019

Frowning, 'Asifa picks up the two keys on the one thread. She holds them out to see where they point.

Vesra

Pressing

14th Oct 2019

Let's continue go north! The spirits whispered me to go there.

Bogs Hothands

14th Oct 2019

Bogs shows less interest in the key(s) than the others.

 to Groto

Friendly

Hey, I bet the inn has a tavern. I would join you for a drink. First ones on me.

Groto

14th Oct 2019

 to Bogs Hothands

That sounds like music to my ears. Lead the way.

'Asifa

14th Oct 2019

The keys still point north. Towards the Wastes.

 to Vesra

Confident

I agree. My key still points north and that's the one I'm following. Let me just pick up a few things and I'll be ready.

 to Bogs HothandsGroto

Pressing

Not too long in their, ok? We've got somewhere to go.

 to Groto

I know you've just been through a lot. We've all been there, not 2 days ago. If you want to come with us, you'll have to pull it together.

 to Bogs Hothands

You fill him in.

'Asifa walks off to get her supplies and once complete will head to the same inn.

Groto

14th Oct 2019

Groto enters the inn, and finds an empty table to sit at.

Tense

Man, what a night...

I'm just realising how close I came to dying.

Relieved

But I'm still here. And I'm thirsty.

 to Bogs Hothands

What are you having?

Bogs Hothands

14th Oct 2019

I’m always looking for a new ale. Beau’s had a good stout not on the menu. I’ll try to get us something special from the barkeep. Oh, do you like ale?

Cheerful

I think I played a gig here one time. I didn’t make much coin, and it is so out of the way, I haven’t seen a reason to come back.

Kail

14th Oct 2019

Exploring the rest of the Market, you do find something you've been seeking for quite a while: a Horn of Silent Alarm.

  

...It's extravagantly overpriced. At 80 Gold, You re-examine your options.

  

The merchant at the magic trinkets stall gives you no smile.

Garreth

14th Oct 2019

Garreth listens to two guards as they patrol;

System

14th Oct 2019

Boros Minotaur: Seen any Gruul lately?

  

Boros Grunt: Yeah, a few. I think they were scouting.

  

Boros Minotaur: Think they're up to something? We had a few come thru the gate. 'Interguild Business', apparently.

  

Boros Grunt: Surprised the gate guards let them through.

  

Boros Minotaur: They'll probably steal or something stupid. And we'll catch them here. give 'em justice.

  

That gate's the only way home for them, unless they wanna walk around the Tenth and deal with the giant beasts.

Slurp Mhhmmm... I have had this one. Just as I remember it. Rich and bitter.

 to Groto

Confident

Yes, I am a musician. It is how I pass the time, how I pay the bills, and how I help my friends. If I didn't have music, I wouldn't be Bogs.

 to Groto

Friendly

I know I can be forgetful, but I can't for the life of me remember your name. I know your companion is Howard, <whispering> who you should probably keep hidden. I don't know how the tavern takes to roden... er, small animals inside their establishment.

Groto

15th Oct 2019

 to Bogs Hothands

Don't worry about Howard. He is very capable of hiding.

Friendly

And my name is Groto. Cheers.

Groto raises his mug and takes a swig of his ale.

Confused

So Bogs, you're telling me all of you are sole survivors of something horrible happening to your group?

Bogs Hothands

15th Oct 2019

Bogs looks around the room for a quiet corner.

Serious

Bogs gets up out of his seat Yea, let's go over there.

Passionate

So... we were all part of a spectacle arranged and orchestrated by a man named Ansem. Each of us came from a group of 5, just like you. Our parties were smashed, ground, punctured, burned, and poisoned. This was dispayed in the gore house arena, with a crowd of thousands cheering every wound. Afterwards, Ansem rewarded us, the survivors with trinkets, gifts. Then all of a sudden he, and everything around us vanished... hands spreading apart

Groto

Confused

15th Oct 2019

Wait. You are telling me you were in an arena and all your teammembers died and a man rewarded you and then everything vanished?

Admiring

I would not mind learning that trick...

Fascinated

But why?

Bogs Hothands

Alarmed

15th Oct 2019

It was horrid.. grotesque! How could you want to learn that? Our lives were completely disposable.

Disgusted

I think it was all for entertainment. Or to glorify Rakdos. The crowd chanted it as we were being slaughtered. Rak-dos, Rak-dos

Groto

Apologetic

15th Oct 2019

Sorry, im just kinda facinated by magic tricks so making a whole arena disapear sounds intriguing. The other stuff sounds truly horrible

Curious

And what about the keys?

Bogs Hothands

Nervous

15th Oct 2019

The key was one his gifts. Asifa received it. We don't know what the others do yet. I'm suspicious of their nature, honestly.

Curious

Which brings us to your key. It must have been created by Ansem. Think back, was anyone in your party involved with the Cult of Rakdos, or the Gore House?

Groto

Worried

15th Oct 2019

I don't know. I don't think so. Isaac was pretty weird though...and Frolin gave me the key.

Tense

But I realy don't know...

Bogs Hothands

15th Oct 2019

Maybe you and Asifa have a connection that you don't know of.

Cheerful

And look at that... The first beer goes down so easy. Let's go top these off.

Groto

15th Oct 2019

Groto totaly forgot about his drink and gulps it down quickly.

He dips his finger inside his almost empty glass and then sticks it inside his sleeve. A small joyfull squick is heard from within his coat.

Tranquil Pond

Pond closes his eyes in a catlike grin at the pun.

'Asifa enters the tavern with a determined pace, new equipment slung over her shoulder and shield on her back.

Ok folks, I've got to catch up to you so send a couple strong ones my way.

When are you all thinking we'll depart?

Tranquil Pond

Amused

15th Oct 2019

I have no strong view. However, these two are now into their second round and are likely to be in their cups shortly. Tomorrow may be... prudent.

'Asifa

Bah, if you can't hold your own against a few drinks then you shouldn't have had them.

Someday I may be so content with personal amusement and on that day I will certainly look to you as a shining example.

Pressing

But today I have a damn key pointing me in some random direction and that's the most direction I've had in years, sad as that may be. So I hope you'll understand my eagerness to get my feet moving one in front of the other.

15th Oct 2019

Asifa, hey. Try the ale. It’s like a fine wine, but with barley. Haha. I know you want to leave soon, but umm... Garreth! I saw him lumbering upstairs earlier. Did you know he didn’t sleep a wink last night?!

'Asifa

15th Oct 2019

'Asifa puts her face in her hand.

Are you saying we can stay the night?

'Asifa

Do you know, I think our electric friend is exasperated with you.

Bogs Hothands

Yea yea. I know. I’m refraining from performing tonight. Isn’t that enough?

Tranquil Pond

15th Oct 2019

 to Bogs Hothands

And just a moment ago you were encouraging me to get on stage.

Pond's eyes flick in amusement between the dragonborn and the genasi, occasionally alighting on Groto to encourage him to join the banter.

Bogs Hothands

Yes I remember, but then I said, we shouldn’t alert the you-know-who’s.

Puzzled

Of course. Look at this glass! This one is smaller than the first one I got, and more slippery.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

15th Oct 2019

It must be a physical property of the glass.

Bogs Hothands

Bogs approaches the bar and orders two more ales. He tromps back to the table with a grin.

Here you are, exalted one. Our fearless leader. Deciferer of key directions.

Where are Kail and Vesra? We are expecting them as well, no?

Tranquil Pond

15th Oct 2019

Pond shrugs nonchalantly, tilting his head and briefly closing his eyes.

Tranquil Pond

Detached

Perhaps the spirits sent them elsewhere. However, Vesra expressed interest in accompanying this group. Kail, I do not know.

15th Oct 2019

Staying the night sounds like a good idea.

But I'm switching to water after this one. I feel like I have had a barrel of ale.

You guys have rooms here?

Tranquil Pond

16th Oct 2019

Pond leans to observe the publican without leaving his chair. He raises his voice a little.

Haughty

Innkeep! We will be staying the night.

 to Groto

Amused

We do now.

Groto

16th Oct 2019

Groto gives a chuckle.

Great.

You know, I'm glad the key brought me to you...

I don't know what I would do on my own right now.

Tranquil Pond

The blue cat eyes narrow and look off to the side.

Something, or nothing, I suppose.

Groto

16th Oct 2019

Groto gives Pond a blank look.

 to Tranquil Pond

Yeah...

Vesra

16th Oct 2019

The door opens and an exhausted Tiefling women enters the pub. Her wings are slacking behind her. Her tail is dragged on the ground. As Vesra spots the group thanks to the Dragonborn and the Catperson she can't resist and a smile casts on her face.

Tired

I should have looked her first.

She says and sits down next to everyone. Curious she inspects the new guy.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

16th Oct 2019

Keeper of Howard, I give you Vesra.

Pond stretches out his arms, reaching for both Vesra's and Groto's hands. He picks up a hand of each tiefling and brings them together, shaking them in his own hands as he grins in amusement.

Vesra

Confused

16th Oct 2019

Well, thanks I guess? I am Vesra Boros Soldier and affiliate of this group. Nice to meet you. Who or what is a Howard?

Groto

16th Oct 2019

Hi. I'm Groto. And this is Howard.

Howard sticks his head out from under Groto's coat, sniffing the air and goes back inside.

He is a bit shy.

You hear a small squick.

That's okay buddy. Come out when you are ready.

Tranquil Pond

16th Oct 2019

Pond's eyes follow the undulating movements of the weasel's head, though he attempts to remain unconcerned.

Vesra

Curious

16th Oct 2019

How come that you are with us? Are you befriended with anyone here?

While talking Vesra gestures the Innkeeper to make her a drink.

16th Oct 2019

Vesra tries to gesture for a shot: Performance: 1d20 (19) (+1) = 20

Bogs Hothands

Cheerful

16th Oct 2019

Vesra, you made it! We were just talking about you. Where is Vesra? Where is Kain? How do you even fly? Why didn't I get wings and a tail? You should see the spirits in this place. All shapes and sizes if you ask me. My favorite is the Barley one. Yup...

Groto

16th Oct 2019

 to Vesra

No, I'm not...

Groto explains what happend and how he met the others

Friendly

...and now I'm sitting here having a drink and hoping I will wake up and be glad it was all a nightmare.

16th Oct 2019

The Bartender, seeing Vesra's gesture, sends over 2 shots of Whiskey; a Boros choice of drink.

Vesra

16th Oct 2019

I don't know where the spirits including the one living in the key will lead us, but I would say the earlier we go the better.

We can always return if we need.

Kail

16th Oct 2019

Finds three urchins and offers them each a silver if they start a fight in the merchants stall. Tells them its worth another silver if they make it good.

Re-enters the stall to peruse the goods while waiting for the urchins to start the brawl. Staying near the item he's got his eye on

Kail

16th Oct 2019

The urchins do as they're told. They begin to fight, attracting the attention of all merchants. Soldiers move to separate the two as blood smears the urchin's mouths.

There was enough time to pick not just one, but two items. (Nat20)

Kail

16th Oct 2019

You take the horn and the pouch. Moments after the Boros separate the urchins, you hear the trickets shop merchant upset over stolen wares.

  

You flip two silvers behind your back as you pass the scuffed urchins, making your way to the bar.

Seems the urchins will remember you, should you ever pass this area again.

Groto

16th Oct 2019

I would not mind some rest, but I would not mind leaving this place either. And traveling at night does have some advantages if we want to leave unseen right?

Tranquil Pond

Amused

17th Oct 2019

Well, it seems as though the general sentiment is... noncommittal. I would not be opposed to a little... nap.

The party can almost hear the word "cat" in the pause before he says "nap".

Bogs Hothands

17th Oct 2019

Bogs continues to buy beer for himself and others until Groto, Asifa, and Vesra decide their buzz is wearing thin. Bogs drunkenness only intensifies, forcing his friends to intervene. Pond continues enjoying the spectacle but is convinced to lend a hand when his friends struggle to handle a 300+ pound dragonborn. Bogs begins to sing, despite his promise not to perform.

“I didn’t write this next one, but it’s Aaa goodie!” <as the party drags Bogs up the stairs>

“The piAno has been drinking, my necktie is aleep, and the carpet needs a haircut, and the spotlight looks like a prison break, as the bouncer is a sumo wrestler cream-puff Casper milktoast, and the newpapers were fooling, and the ash-trays have retired, cause the piano has been drinking, the piano has been drinking, not… me, not me, not me, not… me.”

Finally they reach his room, and close the door to a mumbling and then snoring Bogs Hothands.

Entering the tavern, Kail looks around and sees the party and heads over

17th Oct 2019

Kail momentarily speaks to the party. Afterwards, he is guided by the bartender to his room upstairs.

The rooms are exactly as expected in a seedy area.

  

They have towels, a small amount of soap, running water. But everything is on it's way to being decrepit.

  

You can't help but notice that the 3 or so doorlocks on the front doors have been...used. there are distinct signs of failed forced entries.

Groto

17th Oct 2019

Groto pushes his bed against the door and goes to sleep.

'Asifa

17th Oct 2019

'Asifa sighs and lies down on the bed. She's seen worse. Might as well get some rest if she has nothing better to do. She thinks of her cot in her new house. Not since leaving the home she grew up in has she cared about a place. She locked the doors when she left, the neighbors seem ok. And really, who is going to rob a decrepit old place like that? It'll be fine.

Tranquil Pond

17th Oct 2019

Pond curls up on the ragged bed, tucking his limbs beneath his body and closing his eyes. Soon his whiskers twitch as he dreams of a different time.

Kail

17th Oct 2019

Blocks off the door and window with furniture, then takes the towels and shoves them under the covers while getting under the bed to sleep the night

Vesra

17th Oct 2019

Vesra stays a while a the bar and drinks 3 or 4 more shots. Someone will be angry at her in the garrison because she didn't came today. Anyway there are more important things to do right now. Later the night she sits near the open window and listens to the whispers of the spirits. Spirits of the world and spirits inside her.

He gets up, moves his bed and goes downstairs to get a bite to eat.

'Asifa

As soon as 'Asifa wakes she gets ready for travel and goes down for breakfast, eager for the rest of her group to join her.

Tranquil Pond

19th Oct 2019

Tranquil Pond awakens to loud growling snores in the next room. Ears twitching, he steals next door to find the sleeping Bogs Hothands sprawled out on the tattered mattress.

  

Pond stands over the dragon-man for a few moments, thinking on the best way to take advantage of the situation. His eyes pass over Bogs' belongings and finally fall on the instrument cases piled in a heap together. He creeps to the cases and opens one curiously.

  

Taking the viol and bow out, Pond holds them delicately, if a little awkwardly. He strikes a dramatic pose with the viol under his whiskered chin and the bow in his other outstretched hand. After a brief pause he puts the bow to the strings and scrapes it across, making a horrible racket!

Pond makes another squeal with viol, this time striking the strings closer to his chin to create a higher pitch.

Bogs Hothands

19th Oct 2019

Bogs uncovers one eyeball enough to catch a glimpse of Pond holding his prized viol incorrectly, and striking it with the bow at an angle never intended to.

Annoyed

Is this the torture hour?

Tranquil Pond

19th Oct 2019

Pond's blue eye falls mischievously on Bogs as he raises the bow once more.

Bogs Hothands

19th Oct 2019

Bogs contemplates trying to ignore the noise versus rescuing his favorite instrument from permanent damage.

He decides the latter. But he cannot attack with full force, on the part of his delicate possession.

Bogs jumps up out of bed. The sudden jolt does a number on his head. He nearly topples over, but tries to grab at Pond while catching himself.

Bogs Hothands

Sarcastic

Pond says this before rolling to the side and rising smoothly to his feet again. He shrugs and adopts a rueful expression.

Playful

How am I ever to improve when this is part of the lesson?

Bogs Hothands

19th Oct 2019

Bogs fumbles the viol as it lands on the floor with a thud.

Alarmed

Oh shit!

Bogs picks it up and examines it over. A nick on one side seems to be new.

I’ll fix that later. Won’t affect the tone.

My instruments are my babies! Well.. tattered babies.

Tranquil Pond

19th Oct 2019

Pond's chuckle is part purr, part laugh. He regards the dragonborn and his beloved instrument with a sly expression but says nothing in response to the comment.

Bogs Hothands

Admiring

19th Oct 2019

I like that backflip landing back on your feet move you did. You teach me that, and I’ll teach you scales, to start with.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

19th Oct 2019

For the low price of a gold per hour? Robbery. And I shudder to imagine your spine handling the jump. We'd be much better off putting that money to breakfast. Or dinner. Or whatever meal is appropriate at this bizarre hour.

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

19th Oct 2019

Say no more! I could eat a cow. It should help stop the headache that is beginning to manifest as well.

Bogs gathers his belongings, and assembles them methodically on his person.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

19th Oct 2019

Myself, I am far more interested in that wriggling little creature on the newcomer. Do you think he will sell it to me?

Bogs Hothands

Doubtful

19th Oct 2019

Sell? They seemed quite attached to each other.

Tranquil Pond

Disappointed

19th Oct 2019

Ah. You do not suppose it was merely a coincidence and he is trying to get rid of it?

Pond's face droops in exaggerated disappointment.

Bogs Hothands

Confused

19th Oct 2019

I didn’t know he was trying to get rid of it. I thought he said they were partners?

Bogs starts towards the door.

Confused

Did I.. umm. I Can’t remember actually getting to my room last night, or today. Wait... is it morning?

Tranquil Pond

Amused

19th Oct 2019

Never mind the creature. And I do not know that you could say morning, given the time we took our rest. Come, darling, let us join the group and eat.

I do not believe anyone has actually eaten yet.

Curious

Is everything alright? Was there a struggle upstairs?

But you brought up a good point. (to the innkeeper) I want some breakfast, too.

Groto

Suspicious

20th Oct 2019

I don't want to sound like an asshole but...are you guys capable of traveling the Wastes?

Garreth

20th Oct 2019

We have survived two gauntlets in the last two days where great forces were actively attempting to kill us.

A passively deadly environment should do nothing but strengthen our resolve further.

Tranquil Pond

20th Oct 2019

Pond tilts his head as he regards the tiefling.

Amused

Surely you would be safer as part of a group than not. And what otherwise would you do? Your key, after all, is no longer in your possession.

He nods to 'Asifa.

It's not that I don't trust you, it's just...I dont know...I just met you guys.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

20th Oct 2019

Bogs tramps down the stairs in view of the party. His eyes are heavy, his postures slouched.

Sleepy

Perhaps they serve bowls of Gruul. I’ll need two. That and coffee. Strong coffee.

Curious

Would somebody please enlighten me on the time of day?

Garreth

Chapter 10

Dangerous Rubble

click to edit

4th Nov 2019

The group packs their things, and heads to the Boros Gate: A 20 ft high wall is all that divides this small fringe community against the wrath of the Gruul and its many clans.

The Boros guards question the group: A motley crew of different races and some Boros affiliates. Their concern is fleeting as rampant crime occurs behind the group. "Just be careful out there, soldiers." A Boros to another.

And so the group travels into the wastes, following Asifa's and Groto's keys to promises unknown.

........................................

  

The group walks on for what feel like miles. The further they travel, the less maintained the structures become. Buildings become more worn. The trees stretch higher and higher, fitting where they can. Overgrown weeds in between the cobblestone. Distant animal calls becoming closer and closer.

.......................................

  

The early sun travels from the edge of the sky until it sits directly over the group. High Noon.

.......................................

Finally the road ends. Well, slowly merging with the wild plantlife.

  

The two keys point North, but North is a a 30ft wall of rubble, between two towers that fell onto each other. Briefly looking around, the party has 3 options:

  

1 Climb over the rubble. It's sandy and mostly gravel, but the towers may provide a vantage point.

  

2 Move a few fallen beams and descend down into the tower's sunken levels. The party can see through some structure gaps, the other side seems clear.

  

3 Go around completely. There's a path underneath some fallen rubble, some kind of aesthetic garden tunnel pass from long ago with strong beams that held up against the fallen neighbor buildings. This path snakes around a bit. May take longer to get past it all.

on the other side to make nothing is hidden behind or below the rubble.

Vesra rolls 1d20 | Result is 4 (mod +1)=5

4th Nov 2019

Vesra's wings carry her up, her vantage point from the middle of the tower.

The wind howls slightly. The day is bright. No sudden movements from the rubble, nor the obstacles leading up to the midpoint of the towers.

  

Several miles (several kilometers) away to the Northeast, are 2 smokestacks rising in the air. The source of the smokestacks blocked by tall, broken structures and towers.

YeA! Next time I’ll do the handspring when I wake you up from a drunken stupor.

Suffering

But seriously, we have been walking since last night, this armor is rubbing a sore on my left hip, and my feet are on their final tread. Anyone have a spare pair of size 17 shoe?

Tranquil Pond

4th Nov 2019

Pond's feline smile can only be described as smug.

 to Bogs Hothands

Amused

Come, darling, the time for rest will be after we have traversed this little obstacle. Don't worry, I'll keep you warm.

A person

4th Nov 2019

Bogs opens his eyes wide, shifts the armor over a smidge, and stretches his arms towards the sky.

Sarcastic

Ahh! Was that a cat-like stretch Tranquil Pond ? Ok I’m ready.

Tranquil Pond

Playful

 to Bogs Hothands

You are close. If you are good to me I will teach you proper technique sometime.

Pond bends at the waist and makes his own stretch, back arched and fur ruffling.

Garreth

4th Nov 2019

Garreth marches in solemn silence, setting a swift pace while taking in the foreign surroundings. The rubble and overgrowth inspire him - nature has reclaimed these archaic structures, providing a fresh foundation to rebuild a new order. He meditates on this cycle, and how he might be its catalyst back in Ravnica.

Groto

5th Nov 2019

Hey, buddy. Come here. Groto whispers inside his coat.

Howard comes crawling out one of the sleeves.

Could you maybe go climb that pile of rubble and see whats up there?

And try to be stealthy oke?

Howards gives a small squick and darts off.

5th Nov 2019

Stealth for Howard

Groto 1d20 (16) (+5) = 21

Groto

5th Nov 2019

Guys, hold up for a second. I'v got a neat little trick to show you.

Groto sits down.

5th Nov 2019

Kail tugs his hood down, and slowly moves up the rubble.

  

Howard squeaks happily as he is put in the floor. The tiny furball deftly rushes up the rubble.

Though not as fast as he wanted, Kail is careful not to make any noise as he steps on larger, solid objects in the rubble.

  

Kail makes it to the top of the rubble, underneath the two towers. He sees the smokestacks. Obviously a campfire. Kail looks up to the towers.

  

In his mind, he sees the path that could take him to the top with no issue. He may have the dexterity for a better vantage point.

Howard reaches the top of the rubble in 50 seconds flat. Once there, he can see smokestacks in the distance.

  

On his way back, Howard takes a safer route on a wooden board. He passes by a large skeletal hand with 3 fingers and a thumb. A Loxodon's hand for sure.

  

Howard reports his findings to his master.

Groto

5th Nov 2019

Groto tells the group what he saw.

'Asifa

5th Nov 2019

If there seems to be no danger here perhaps we should take the time to go around this obstacle.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

5th Nov 2019

Pardon, but if there is no danger that seems exactly the reason to go over, does it not?

'Asifa

Friendly

5th Nov 2019

 to Tranquil Pond

Not everyone is quite as addept at climbing as yourself. But we'll manage either way no doubt.

Tranquil Pond

5th Nov 2019

Without waiting any further, Pond begins climbing the wreckage.

5th Nov 2019

Pond begins to climb.

Bogs Hothands

5th Nov 2019

Bogs lumbers on, following the others, near the back of the party.

'Asifa

Curious

5th Nov 2019

The rest of you climbing then?

Kail

5th Nov 2019

Or do we check out down below. Before moving on?

Groto

5th Nov 2019

Reluctantly, Groto starts climbing.

Garreth

5th Nov 2019

Garreth, accustomed to his mountainside morning constitutionals, picks his way up and over the rubble.

Tranquil Pond

5th Nov 2019

Tail swishing, Pond looks back to Garreth with a smirk.

 to Garreth

Amused

Your body does not seem... suited to this locomotion.

Garreth

5th Nov 2019

 to Tranquil Pond

A body is naturally suited to anything. Think of the infant's helplessness. And yet, it may be conditioned to accomplish any task, should the mind have the strength to allow it.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

5th Nov 2019

 to Garreth

How interesting. You should write a book with all that wisdom.

6th Nov 2019

The party makes their way up.

  

Garreth's foot finds the corner of a hollow container in the midpoint of the rubble.

6th Nov 2019

 whispered to Bogs Hothands

A faint crack can be heard. You look to your party, to confirm of they heard it as well.

  

Seems you were the only one to hear it. It came from Garreth's vicinity.

  

...the rubble, sand and gravel underneath him is... sinking.

  

You feel an urge to shout at him, and warn Garreth. Before the rubble sinks further and swallows him whole.

6th Nov 2019

Bogs pauses for a moment; something is off.

Bogs Hothands

Alarmed

Garreth! Move away from where you stand!

 to Garreth

This is no time for somersaults.

6th Nov 2019

Garreth looks around, his arms ready to strike whatever comes their way. He doesn't expect the rubble and gravel underneath him to give.

Garreth sinks down to his knees in the rubble as the little pile collapses. He was directly over the sinkhole.

The rest of the party makes it out fine, scambling to the edges of the rubble pile unscathed.

The collapse settles. Garreth fishes his legs out from the rubble. His skin is grazed amd covered in dust, but he's fine and able.

6th Nov 2019

System rolls 1d4 | Result is 1

Garreth

6th Nov 2019

Your shins are bloodies and dusted.

6th Nov 2019

A moment of silence.

...

...

...

...

In the distance, the deep rhythm of drums.

  

A cacaphony of yells and screams.

Seems the collapse has attracted the attention of unknown parties.

The collapse has blocked off the entries under the towers. Whatever container Garreth had found has traveled deep into the rubble.

Tranquil Pond

6th Nov 2019

From the top of the rubble, Pond brings out his quarterstaff and whirls it with a smirk as he turns his eyes and ears in the direction of the sound.

6th Nov 2019

What is it?

Tranquil Pond 1d20 (15) + Perception = 19

Garreth

6th Nov 2019

Garreth dusts his shins and stands next to Tranquil Pond.

 to Tranquil Pond

What do you see? Friend or foe?

'Asifa

7th Nov 2019

A wind picks up around 'Asifa as her eyes shine white.

Bogs Hothands

Pensive

7th Nov 2019

We aren’t trying to hide are we?

Groto

Nervous

7th Nov 2019

Can't we hide near those towers at the top?

7th Nov 2019

Pond hears the echoes of the drums Northeast; the steps and war cries of a troop, echoing off the stone surfaces of the ruins around them. Echoes have a way of making sounds larger than they are.

  

It's a minute detail, but the drums are increasing in pitch. They're making their way to the group.

7th Nov 2019

 whispered to Tranquil Pond

You estimate that they'll arrive within 8 minutes.

Bogs Hothands

7th Nov 2019

Bogs hurries to catch up to the others, making their way to the top of the ruins.

Kail

7th Nov 2019

Let's move

Points to a set of neighboring buildings closer to the smokestacks

Then proceeds to head down the rubble towards them

'Asifa

7th Nov 2019

'Asifa checks the direction of the key.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

7th Nov 2019

We have approximately eight minutes to prepare, if my ears are right. And of course they are right. So, shall we take this opportunity to make a little plan rather than rushing in?

Kail

7th Nov 2019

Or we leave. We have 8 minutes to not be here

7th Nov 2019

Asifa's keys tugs a little stronger, further North.

Kail

7th Nov 2019

See the key has it, let's go

Tranquil Pond

7th Nov 2019

Pond makes a regal shrug.

Bogs Hothands

7th Nov 2019

Bogs differs to the wisdom of his more perceptive friends.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

7th Nov 2019

 to Kail

Very well. Lead the way... what was your name again? Never mind.

7th Nov 2019

Kail leads, the group behind his heels. Dust lingers in the air.

He maneuvers past large bushes and stone pillars through ruined doorways, his back to the walls.

A good amount of ground was covered.

7th Nov 2019

Stealth

Kail Im rolling... we're all doomed... 1d20 (17) (+7) = 24

7th Nov 2019

The drums gradually weaken, until they can't be heard. The group moves slowly North.

The wind rustles the flora around the group. Kail pauses.

  

# Chapter 7: Danger afoot

  
  

 whispered to Kail

Instinctively you throw your hand up, fingers straight palm open; the signal to stop. That wasn't just the wind. You know better.

  

You peek behind a stone opening that once was a window. Shards of glass among the overgrowth. You're careful not to peer out too far out the window.

  

The party is in a ruined home, over a 60ft (18m) cliff formed by an earthquake of sorts.

  

At the bottom of the cliff are 3 humanoids, wielding weapons and armors of leather and bone. Above them, a 10ft (3m) ogre wearing a battledrum and a slim tree trunk with leaves still on it holstered on his back.

  

They don't see the group.

  

You feel you should warn the party.

Kail whispers. “3 at the base, ogre up top. Shut up and keep low. Wait till they get bored and move on.”

Bone Club Savage: You boys see anything?

Drum Ogre: Hhhrrrrrm.

  

Garreth

to Kail

Only three? We have the numbers. We are not here to tiptoe around the savage wastes. We are here to boldly forge our own path. Surely this should be an opportunity to assert our might.

Bogs Hothands

Nervous

  

If we did, we would have to be quick. We wouldn’t want them alerting more attention.

'Asifa

Pressing

 to Garreth

Shhhh! You can assert your might on your own time! We need invite no more obstacles than necessary.

  

Garreth

Pressing

In the interest of solidarity, I will support your decision. I will continue to advise, though, a course of swift, fearsome action as long as we journey together.

  

Groto

Tense

I would rather not fight anything if we can just avoid it.

Can't we just sneak past them..?

  

The party takes turns peeking at the threats out a ruined home, over a 60ft (18m) cliff formed by an earthquake of sorts.

  

If a chase were to occur, the pack of savages could scale up the cliff through a series of broken structures and overgrown buildings.

  

Bone Thug: I know i heard something out here. Rubble falling or something.

Drum Ogre: All fall all time. Why this time special?

Bone Club Savage: Shut your big, ugly gob, Grommus. We feed you to lift things, not think. Just do as your told.

  

Despite his bulging muscles and swollen facial features, Grommus is visibly upset.

He turns away from the group and leans against a wall, only for the wall to collapse bringing Grommus down with it.

  

The rest of the group chuckle and laugh at Grommus. He faces the cliff wall in shame.

Kail

  

whisper they'll move on shortly. Removing them warns folks we're here. whisper

Bogs struggles to keep himself quiet. Never before has he done so much sneaking.

  

Stealth

  

Asifa leans closer down.

A slip of balance.

She grabs the stone wall, only for a brick to come loose and fall off.

  

Tranquil Pond rushes over and manages to catch the brick over hand, mere inches (centimeters) away from falling down the cliff.

  

Bogs reacts, trying to catch the brick, only to trip moving forward. His scale mail loudly jingling, moments away from slamming loudly onto the floor.

  

Garreth waits not a moment. Instinctively he shoves Groto towards Bogs, hoping to use him as a Teifling pillow to cushion Bog's fall.

  

Groto roll backwards in such a way that doesn't make too much sound. Thoughts of Howard's safety gives you super-tiefling strength as you stabilize the 200lbs (90kg) Dragonborn with your feet, and his many instruments with your arms.

  

Bone Club Savage looks up.

Bone Club: ...

Amused

  

Spear Savage: What is it?

Bone Club: ...ehh. just birds.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond deftly rights himself and comes into a defensive crouch. He offers a pawlike hand to any others who wish to take it.

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs eases himself off Groto. He turns looking sheepishly at the gang. wipes a bead on sweat from his brow

  

Groto scrambles to his feet.

  

Whispering My god...how much do you weigh?

  

Haha. Enough. Just enough. You are mighty strong Groto. Thank you for that.

  

The party is currently in a small ruined home, just above a cliff.

At the end of the cliff, a group of savages from what they look like.

  

All around the party are ruined structures, except for a somewhat cleared cobblestone path heading North.

Tranquil Pond

  

Pond peeks out at the possible assailants before turning back to his companions, looking from one to the next. His voice is a purring whisper.

Amused

So. Is the preference to sneak away quietly? Possible, possible. However, should we wish a more direct approach it may be possible to happen upon them from behind and eject them from this vertical point, if you follow my meaning...

  

Garreth

That would surely send a strong message. It seems we are more alike than you would give credit.

  
  

Pond's expression sours.

I should hesitate to ever compare to you, Master Garreth.

  

Garreth

Comparison would be fruitless - we are, after all, individuals. But common ground is always worth acknowledgement

  

Pond begins smoothing his whiskers and the fur around his ears after delicately licking a finger.

  

Kail

Then you have hundreds after you. If they dont come back? Others will know. Let them get bored, dont let your pride and ego make this painfully difficult when it doesn't need to be

  

Bogs Hothands

I agree. Im not trying to be a hero.

  

Tranquil Pond

Amused

 to Kail

Pride? Ego? Moi? Please, I am the soul of humility... What was your name again? Never mind.

Bogs Hothands

Bogs chuckles a bit. He remembers Kail’s name, but remains silent, content to the awkwardness.

  

Garreth

We are no heroes. Harbingers, rather. A truly selfless act to put the message above one's own safety.

 to Tranquil Pond

Shall we leave a mark on this land?

  

Groto

Tense

Are we going to wait here? What if that other group behind us catches up?

Groto looks backwards, making sure they are still save.

Tense

I rather take my chances with those guys over there…

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond moves to face an unoccupied corner of the derelict building. The party can hear the faint patter of falling liquid and a dark, dripping trail seeps down the wall from his hip height as he adjusts his clothing and returns to sit among the group.

  

 to Garreth

Amused

I feel I have already left my mark on this land, but I shall happily watch you leave yours.

Bogs Hothands

Annoyed

  

Unngh. Nice mark , Tranquil Pond . Couldn’t that have waited?

Tranquil Pond

  

A lazy smile crosses Pond's face as he turns his head to regard Bogs.

 to Bogs Hothands

Amused

  

You had best ask Master Garreth - I was only fulfilling his request.

Garreth

Confident

 to Tranquil Pond

A true demonstration of discipline - to produce on command. Even as you mock our calling, you affirm your role in it.

Groto

  

Groto mumbles something under his breath and makes a delecitae movement with his hand.

 to Tranquil Pond

Looks like your aim is off friend.

He points at a dark stain near Ponds groin.

The group remains, hidden well amongst the shaded corners and overgrowth.

The pitter patter of hooves hitting cobblestone.

A centaur in familiar leather and bone apparel makes her way to the 4 other, passing by the structure the group was hiding in.

  

The savages all rise to their feet. Grommus stops sulking and rises.

Centaur: They're long gone. A group of 5, maybe more.

  

Humanoids, one dragonkind. They have some sort of smaller, bipedal maaka, I believe.

Bone Club: Baypedul?

The centaur gives him a disappointing look.

Centaur: walks on two legs.

Let's move. I think i smelled maaka piss on the way here.

  

Wordlessy, they follow the centaur's lead. They head East, away from the group.

Minutes pass in silence. The familiar sound of birds chirping, wind rustling the 9 or so tree leaves all around return. It's quite peaceful.

  

With nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, the group takes their leave and heads further North.

... the journey seems long and arduous. Crossing over ruins, boulders, streams and other such natural obstacles .

  

It feels as though the group has traveled well over 24 miles.

  

The sun has moved to the skyline where it bathes the ruins in a warm, orange hue.

  

Nighttime will arrive soon.

Bogs Hothands

Suffering

Can we PleaSe stop?! I cannot take another step.

Amused

I nominate Pond for first watch; reparations for the... what was it Garreth, “mark on the world” we were subjected to involuntarily.

Kail

Annoyed

  

By the hells, it's been just a few minutes since your last break!

Groto

Tired

  

Yeah, lets find a place to rest...

Tranquil Pond

Amused

  

By all means I will take first watch. After that, uninterrupted sleep.

Pond seems to be in good spirits, his lazy smile never leaving his face.

The group sets their bedding and supplies down.

  

Kail advises to build a fire along a stone wall, to reflect the heat and lower visibility.

Pond quickly maneuvers up the tallest structure around: a 20ft tall ruined watch tower with a broken wooden ladder.

...

The campfire warms the party. It's serenely quietly here in the wastes. Cricket chirps in the distance.

  

The party gathers around the fire, eating their rations and drinking from their waterskins. There are many questions that they have for each other.

  

Pond occasionally peeks back to the group, his fur sufficiently keeping him warm in the cool, night breeze.

  

Tranquil Pond's watch is uneventful. With the occasional yawn, he happily relinquishes his watch for his long deserved catnap.

  

Pond climbs down from the tower and looks at each of his sleeping companions in turn. Turning to Garreth, he tucks a foot under the slumbering man's ribs and rolls him sideways to wake him up.

  

Garreth's eyes open as if he had never been asleep to begin with. It is unsettling. He sits in a meditative repose, eyes and ears open to the night air.

  

“It is your watch. Do not forget to be vigilant.”

  

Garreth

“We are become vigilance, here at the vanguard of progress.”

  

Tranquil Pond

“Fascinating. Well, don't let me keep you.”

Pond lies down and immediately goes to sleep.

  
  

# Chapter 8: A Scaly Friend

Garreth sits in his meditative position, his breathe slow; his eyes closed and his ears open to the world.

  

A twig snaps.

  

Garreth opens his eyes, searching for the source. In the distance, the flickering of a small flame, igniting and dying over and over again. Garreth stands up amongst his group. The flame ignites once more, brighter than ever. You can make out the silhouette of a small creature; it has a tail, and glossy skin. Similar to Bogs'.

  

It waves at you, and walks towards you and the party campfire.

  

Standing 20 feet away from Garreth is a small , 3 foot (1 meter) lizard-person. Its left hand outstretched over itself, a flickering flame hovering in its palm.

  

It wears light armor of leather and bone. A large femur bone hangs from its hip.

  

(You think?) It smiles at you.

  

Lizard person: hiiiii. Lost?

  

Garreth

We are where we need to be. Can you say the same?

  

The lizardkin leans its head to the side, looking at the party. Then back to Garreth, specifically at his clothes.

  

Lizard Person: Red. White. Boros?

It pulls at its own armor, excitedly.

Admiring

Lizard Person: I'sz Gruul. Our people fight lots, yesz?

  

But no fight. I'sz no want fight. Peace.

It comes a little closer to Garreth.

  

Lizard Person: Help? I helpsz.

  

Garreth contemplates the reptilian's attire, and glances down at his own. He looks back up to meet the creature's eye.

  

Confident

I am Boros no longer. These colors mean nothing - relics lost to changing times. We may have more in common than our costumes would suggest.

  

Have you come to ambush us? That would be unwise.

  

Examining the creature, you feel no ulterior motives. The way it moves, looks around, smiles(?) It seems to be of good character.

  

Kail

  

Never met a Gruul that wants peace

  

Bogs is fast asleep. Zzzz.

  

Lizard Person: Ambush? No, I helpsz. Stranger from big bright city help I, long ago. 'Return the favor', He says.

  
  

Lizard Person: No stranger, no Karantok. So I helpz you today, you help other tomorrow.

 whispered to Kail

Your owl returns after a brief flight. Perched upon a tree. Because it didn't perch on you, you know immediately there are no others except for this 'Karantok'.

  

Karantok: so I helpsz? I know where mean Gruul scavenge. Where maaka go.

Kail

Amused

Sure, why not. Grab a place over there points at Tranquil Pond what's one more.

  

Pond is currently stretched out with all four limbs curled inward over his body, a repetitive, purring snore emitting from his throat. His bare feet twitch occasionally as he sinks deeper in the dream of hunting mustelids.

  

Garreth

We need soldiers. Visionaries. Folks of conviction. What are you?

  

Kail Looks over at Tranquil Pond then back to Garreth and rolls his eyes

System

Confused

Karantok: mmmmm scrap hunter?

Karantok: I'z know area. Keep all from danger.

Karantok inches closer to the campfire, to the spot by Tranquil Pond.

Karantok: Ooo... this maaka small.

Karantok looks to the member's faces, seeing if its actions are tolerable to this group.

 to Kail

Admiring

Karantok: Can cook? You know?

  

Kail

Takes a deep sniff. Yep, already a step up. Excellent.

  

Karantok takes a seat by Tranquil Pond, as it warms up by the fire. Occasionally, Karantok steals a glance of Tranquil sleeping.

Other than their new guest, this watch ends peacefully.

  

Garreth

Garreth looks to the party, wondering who to wake up for this last leg of watch.

Garreth wonders. Maybe for the next camp rest, they decide who takes watch before sleeping. As to not burden those who truly need sleep.

  

Garreth taps Kail's shoulder, signaling a switch.

  

As Kail readies himself, Garreth retires to his bedroll.

  

Karantok stays awake, its yellow slit pupils looking about.

  

About an hour into Kail's watch, Karantok approaches next to Kail, staring at him.

  

Several times it opens its mouth as to say something, but decides against it.

  

Kail

You can smell that this lizard person faintly smells of raw meat.

Thinks to himself that it smells better than some members of the group

Curious

Yes? You obviously wish to speak.

  

Karantok

Ah! ..Hee... So why all here?

How I helpz?

How you get small maaka? I'z wantz!

Karantok gestures to Bogs.

Curious

And big Viashino.

Kail

Amused

You're welcome to the maaka, if it'll go. Might need a bath, and the Viashino, well both were acquired when a friend asked me to watch them.

  

Karantok becomes happy(?) to hear it can keep Tranquil Pond. It's forked tongue darts in and out of its mouth.

Karantok

  

Where all going?

  

Kail looks around briefly, looking for any possible 'friends' of Karantok that would ambush them. Nothing.

  

He turns his body to the lizard person and stares into his yellow reptile eyes, his face mere inches (cm) away from Karantok.

  

Karantok simply smiles(?) back, his tongue occasionally darting out, his head tilted a bit to the side.

  

Karantok

Yes? Questions for I?

  

Kail

Serious

North. But I want you to listen to me now. Understand that I am being utterly honest. If you fuck with me. I'll gut you and turn you into my next pair of boots.

Cheerful

Have a good night!

  

Karantok

It takes your word to heart. With its eyes on you, it slowly slinks away to put the campfire between you and itself.

  

Kail continues to keep watch of the group, his hands balancing his dagger. He keeps Karantok within his field of vision.

  

Karantok

...be back.

Food for all.

Karantok

Karantok leaves its backpack and club by the fire.

Karantok runs off into the night.

  

Kail continues his watch.

Kail put his hands to his mouth and makes a series of bird noises.

  

Sudden movement in the trees overhead.

  

 whispered to Kail

Does the party know of the owl?

Kail

  

No

  

 whispered to Kail

I believe you whispered it to me, on the first mention

 whispered to Kail

Ah. Kk.

Kail

  

They dont know I have a familiar

  

...hours pass.

The sun makes an appearance over the skyline.

 whispered to Kail

Your owl returns, moments before Karantok returns. The owl perches on a tree. Again, nothing dangerous to report.

Karantok

Excited

  

“Baaack!”

13th Nov 2019

Karantok returns, with a small bounty of fish, rabbits, 2 birds and a giant bug.

  

Karantok lays it down by the campfire.

The lizard person's call was loud enough to wake all the party members.

  

Vesra

Vesra's eyes shoot open. She grabs her weapon and gets up ready for battle.

 to Kail

Alarmed

Kail! What's happening? Who is this?

Kail

Amused

  

We acquired a new friend in the night. Wants to help. Not my shift.

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs rolls over at the unfamiliar voice. His eyes open slowly. The creature startles him to sit up faster than he would have otherwise.

Alarmed

Hey, what’s going on? Who is this?

Vesra

Alarmed

A new friend, apparently.

  

Karantok

Excited

Hiiii.

 to Bogs Hothands

I Karantok! Viashino, like you.

  

Karantok offers the big bug it caught to Bogs.

Excited

Hungry? You want cooked?

Bogs Hothands

Baffled

13th Nov 2019

 to Karantok

You, um.. like me?

 to Karantok

Amused

Yes, cooked please. I would eat anything at this point.

Confused

Would someone explain how we found the company of this... lizard person?

  

Kail

Takes the game and fish, dresses the game and hangs it. Guts and cleans the fish and then pulls a small pouch whispers to it and pulls some seasoning before starting to cook the fish.

Talk to Garreth

  

Bogs Hothands

Relieved

Seeing that he has yet not cut our throats is a good sign.

Karantok

Admiring

  

 to Bogs Hothands

I'z like strong onesz. You like I, Karantok, but bigger! You strong!

Karantok casually throws the big bug over the fire.

  

It squirms extra loud as the bug's 16 something legs writhe in agony.

Human man there says I'z can help. You all go North, yes?

  

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

 to Karantok

Oh I see, I’m like you, yes. We have scaly bodies. We are similar. A little different, but similar.

Bogs immediately realizes the useful nature of Karantok.

  

Friendly

I’m Bogs, nice to meet you. extends a hand to shake

 to Garreth

Kail

Cheerful

I see why you kept him around.

  

Karantok

Karantok just stares at Bog's extended hand. Then looks up Bogs, his tongue darting in and out.

  

Food ready in small while. Hope big Viashino hungry!

  
  

Bogs’ demeanor changes slightly.

 to Karantok

Why are you helping us?

  

Karantok

Excited

 to Bogs Hothands

Viashino

It is good to see a fellow Viashino amongst this group! I do genuinely wish to help you all in your goals to reach the North, whatever may be waiting for you there.

Viashino

Why I help, you ask? To 'pay it forward' as one did for me long ago.

  

Bogs Hothands

Puzzled

 to Karantok

Slow down. Slow down. Can you say that in common? I don’t speak your native tongue. I realize I look a bit like you, but I’m not. I am a kind of like Niv-Mizzet. Not exactly, but similar. This is confusing I imagine.

  

Karantok looks at you with a sad(?) expression. Moments later, its once again excited.

Human help Karantok once. 'Pay it forward', He said.

Excited

I'z help now, you help other later.

Other help Karantok when need.

  

Bogs Hothands

Curious

  

 to Karantok

Do you remember the human’s name?

Karantok

Excited

  

... no. No member.

Garreth

This one claims to help us carve a swifter path through these lands. Either they speak truth, or they lie, and thrust us into yet another gauntlet. The result is the same - a step closer to our destination.

  

Groto wakes up.

Sleepy

Morning all.

He looks at the strange Lizard.

  

I dont know who was suppose to keep watch but he did an amazing job...

He clearly kept us save by not letting a strange Lizard person in our camp.

  

What the hell guys? Who is that?

  

A nose and a pair of whiskers poke out of Groto's sleeve accompanied by a small growl.

  

Kail

Amused

Ain't it grand? Once again, ask Garreth.

  

Pond stretches lazily, seemingly unbothered by the commotion. As he sits up he tilts his head at the reptilian creature before glancing at Bogs.

  

 to Bogs Hothands

Amused

... Your cousin, darling?

Bogs Hothands

Sarcastic

  

 to Tranquil Pond

Yes. How’d you guess?

  

Tranquil Pond

It was either that or your illegitimate child, and I know you would never be unfaithful to me.

  

Bogs Hothands

 to Groto

He seems ok. He caught food, knows the land, and genuinely seems to want to help.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond's eyes follow the darting movement of the little creature predatorily.

  

Bogs Hothands shrugs his shoulders.

You caught me. Though it was before we met.

  

Tranquil Pond

Disappointed

  
  

... Does that mean this creature is off the menu?

  

Groto

Curious

 to Bogs Hothands

Food?

I could eat...

Bogs watches the scaly creature, racking his brain for why this reptile wants to assist the party.

These are wild lands. Maybe this lizard thing is using the group for safety for now.

Looking at the food it brought, it all seems fresh. The eyes of the fish aren't bloody or discolored. Either way, seems the lizard person is safe. For now.

  

Karantok

 to Groto

Oh! I'z bring food!

Karantok points to the game and fish, being cleaned and prepared by Kail.

Karantok approaches and looks at Tranquil Pond.

  

Maaka talk! Waaaaaa

  

Bogs Hothands

No, you may not eat my illegitimate son!

  

Oh, he likes you too.

  

Kail

I know. How lucky are you!

Pulls the fish from the fire, and then pulls more from his seasonings and looks up.

Foods on.

  

Groto

Suspicious

 to Kail

You sure it's safe?

  

Kail

Oh I know poisons my friend, this is fine. Better than fine, with my patented spice and herb blend.

  

Groto shrugs and gets up to eat some breakfast

  

Groto

Yeah...it's pretty nice. For fish.

  

Karantok grabs his bug-shell from the dying campfire and hits it with a nearby branch.

  

The shell opens up, revealing a steaming underbelly and an odd smell. Like barbeque, but chemically.

  

Karantok offers the bugshell to Bogs.

  

try?

  

Pond wrinkles his nose from where he sits.

If I cannot have the creature, I will take fish.

He's sulking.

  

Bogs Hothands

Nervous

 to Karantok

Of course. Let me have a little slurpy crunch.

Bogs pretends to enjoy it more than is warranted.

 to Tranquil Pond

Excited

Pond, you must try this. It’s simply divine. handing over the shell

Tranquil Pond

  

Pond's eyes narrow sceptically as he inspects the dragonborn for falsehood.

Mmm tasty

  

Tranquil Pond

Amused

 to Bogs Hothands

And deny you the opportunity to eat it all when it is so delicious? No, no, I could not possibly. Go on, take another bite.

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs does, but his act is up. He struggles to maintain composure, gulping down another slimy/chewy bit.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond's purring chuckle is slightly sardonic as he fluidly comes to his feet, stalks over to the fire, and retrieves a fish. His eyes flick to the little lizard-person on his way by.

  

Kail

Oh no I didn't mean you could eat Tranquil Pond . You'd need permission like a proper Maaka.

  

Tranquil Pond

Haughty

 to Kail

...Excuse me?

  

Kail

Amused

points at Karantok Go on. Ask for permission.

  

Pond's mouth drops open as he looks incredulously between Kail and Karantok. He draws himself up to his full lanky six feet.

Annoyed

I have just remembered my morning meditation calls. Do not wait; I will eat rations.

He drops the fish in the dust and stalks to a corner of the group, sitting down and closing his eyes.

  

Bogs watches the interaction with bewilderment.

  

Kail laughs.

  

Karantok takes back his bugshell and eats quietly in peace.

All go North? I'z know safe way. No much danger. Under, over trees, stone.

  
  

Bogs strolls over sitting next to Karantok.

in a hushed voice It was you Pond wanted to hunt. He is no house cat. If you were planning on making a meal of him, you may find yourself in the belly of the beast, if you catch my drift.

  

Groto picks up the fish from the ground and kleans it with Prestidigitation.

Here you go buddy.

He stuffs it in his coat.

  

Karantok

Curious

Oo...

  

Vesra packs her things.

After breakfast, let's get a move on, yes?

  

Karantok

  

We go? Yesz! Follow.

Shortly after everyone finishes the day's meal, Karantok leads the way North.

  

Asifa follows behind with keys in hand, followed by Kail's watchful eyes.

  
  

The group travels very peacefully and without care. Karantok leads. It occasionally passes through small passages, only to reappear on higher ground.

  

## Vesra's Notes

Day 2

 through the wastes: We met a small lizard person named Karantok, who suddenly came to us in the dead of night on Garreth's watch. I don't trust the little thing. But it seems Tranquil Pond and Bogs has grown an affinity for it.

  

#### Day 3

Nothing odd to report. Karantok is still with us.

  

We stumbled upon deer today, foraging through what once was a small town. Long deserted.

We looked around for anything we could use, but all the metal was rusted through and the wood was rotten.

#### Day 5

  

Karantok stopped us from proceeding today. The little thing was serious.

It knelt low to the ground and darted it's tongue rapidly. Quicker than i've ever seen it do.

  

In an instant, it told us to rub grass, mud, dirt, all over ourselves and to drop our things in a pile. We did so quickly.

We followed Karantok into a collapsed house, into the basement where there was a rusted grating. An outlet for air.

  

Then we heard it. Gentle growling. From outside. Some sort of monster.

We must have waited in that basement for an hour or so, barely moving. Karantok's tongue just shooting out like a woodpecker's beak on wood.

  

Finally, it gave us the go ahead to get out stuff.

When we came back, our stuff was rustled about, thrown in every direction. Whatever it was, took just the rations.

All around our stuff were tracks in the grass. Tracks like a lion, or a tiger. Except the pawprints were 4ft (1.3m) wide.

"Maaka", Karantok says. "We go."

  

We gathered our stuff and went.

#### Day 7

  

We've been making this trek for a week now. The pull of Asifa's key has gotten so strong that she's tied it to her weapon. Otherwise it would leave a red mark on her neck.

  

Karantok's been a great help. We walked into other Viashino(?), little lizard people just like Karantok. He spoke to them, and with smiles on their faces they gave us enough of these dried fruit bars to make up half of the rations we lost.

  

The little things were drawn to Tranquil Pond and Bogs. "Little Maaka" and "Strong Viashino", they would call them in what little Common they knew.

#### Day 8

We've finally arrived. After travelling some 200 miles (321km) we've finally arrived.

  

...My feet hurt.

  

We cut through some tall grass, and ended up on a cliff overlooking a broken down an ancient castle: its walls long since breached.

  

The party tried to go around, but the keys; they pointed straight at it.

...We found ourselves at the entrance of the 100ft (30m) tall castle: The dropped drawbridge covered in mold. Thick vines grew all around the castle walls. Numerous breaches through the stone walls.

  

A rusted metal gate gave entry into the structure.

  

Whatever's inside this castle was Ansem's gift meant for Asifa.

  

Can't go back now.

  

# Chapter 9: The Castle

The group huddles together to discuss the plan.

Kail

I'll have the owl check the courtyard

ehh. 15. Around the same.

Yeps

 whispered to Kail

The owl takes off and scouts the courtyard.

  

..The courtyard is overgrown with grass, potted plants and flowers. Water still flows in the main water fountain at the center of the courtyard.

  

...All throughout the courtyard, broken siege warfare equipment and bleached bones of various races. Goblins, Minotaurs, Loxodons. Mostly human.

  

The equipment too, is overgrown with a green moss.

  

Aside from the movement of some rats, it seems devoid of any living creature.

 whispered to Kail

  

Bogs Hothands

Desperate

Again! 99 tankards of beer on the wall, 99 tankards of beer, you take one down, pass it around, 98 tankards of beer on the wall... Oh, 98 tankards of beer on the wall, 98 tankards of beer, you take one down, pass it around, 97 tankards of beer on the wall... Oh, look. A castle... everyone! 97 tankards of beer on the wall, 97 tankards of beer, you take one down, pass it around, 96 tankards of beer on the wall...

  

Doubtful

We may as well finish it at this point. We are already down to 96.

  

Vesra crosses her arms and looks to the group.

These voices I got from Ansem.. they've calmed down a bit. One of them says that we have to go into the crypts.

  

'Asifa

  

'Asifa had become more and more introspective, hardly saying a thing for the last two days. Now she stares at the gate with both determination and trepidation. What will she find in there?

Vesra

13th Nov 2019

...And that they feel something down there. A faint something.

Karantok

13th Nov 2019

Karantok looks up at the group, tugging at Kail.

Tense

I'z scavenge near castle. Big things avoid here. Maaka not come here.

13th Nov 2019

Asifa's keys pull on her blade strongly. It feels like the pull of a grown man. Or a baby minotaur at the least.

13th Nov 2019

 whispered to 'Asifa

It's something like a 10lb pull. very distracting, but doesn't hinder battle.

Tranquil Pond

Suffering

13th Nov 2019

 to Bogs Hothands

Darling, while you know I love your renditions of old folk songs, I know I speak for us all when I say please, no more.

'Asifa

13th Nov 2019

'Asifa sighs.

Pensive

The gate is open. Let's go.

13th Nov 2019

Asifa inches to the drawbridge. Karantok follows.

Kail

13th Nov 2019

 whispered to System

Telepathic link within 1 mile. I can also choose to use their senses. But then I lose mine while doing so

Kail

13th Nov 2019

Nothin living in the courtyard. Mostly bones, human, goblin, and minotaur.

Let's move.

13th Nov 2019

 whispered to Kail

GoT Warg. got it.

 whispered to Kail

I'll be sure to put that in. The party will notice your eyes go white, unless you go somewhere private

Bogs Hothands

Amused

  

 to Tranquil Pond

I am trying to figure out how all of this is going to further my musical interests. Though, I will relieve you of my vocal exercises for the time being.

Garreth

  

Garreth seeks to learn more of the new companion as they journey forth.

 to Karantok

I understand the Gruul are practitioners of the "Old Ways." What does that mean to you?

  

Karantok turns to Garreth.

Karantok

Amused

  

Ilharg! End Raze!

 to Garreth

How you know?

  

The obvious sound of multiple footsteps behind the party. Someone else is here.

  

 whispered to Kail

Your owl hoots wildly.

  

Kail turns to see a group of haggard looking humanoids, 30ft (10m) south of the party.

Kail

Hey! Who are you!?

The party turns, their weapons drawn.

Karantok equips its femur club.

  

# Chapter 10: Unexpected Guests

After finding the structure that Ansem's key leads to, the group is surprised by a few haggard looking humanoids.

  

Vesra points her blade at the interlopers. Before the party stands:

-An Elven Selesnyan Ranger

-An Elf with a holstered Rapier

-A Human with a perfectly symmetrical face

  
  

-A Half Elf Bard

Vesra

Alarmed

You know these elves, Karantok?

  

Karantok

Alarmed

(*Hisses)

I'z think danger.

  
  

Selesnyan Elf: Wait, wait, folks. Please.

With both hands in the air, the Elf in Selesnyan Leather Armor slowly reaches into a breast pocket. He takes out a Selesnyan Insignia: proof of his allegiance with the Conclave in Ravnica.

  

Friendly

My name is Orfan. I'm a ranger of the Selesnyan Concave. I can see i'm dealing with fellow peacekeepers. 2 Boros Soldiers, right?

Tranquil Pond
Amused
Peace! A lofty goal. You may find you share it with some of us, if not all.

  

Me and my acquaintance, Frisk here, were enjoying a cup of coffee in the 2nd Precinct about a week or so ago. That's when the Rakdos started to riot. A few Golgari led us down into their sectors to get away from the chaos. But we, uhh, we got lost. Detached from the main group.

We've been out here in the Wastes since, foraging and hunting small game to stay alive.

  

Now I'm trained to fend for myself. But...

He gestures to the other three.

Friendly

This place is a maze. With all the towers and shadows, it can get hard to discern North and South. You'd need a local to show you the way to safety or something.

  

..we need your help.

  

Vesra

Slowly, Vesra puts her sword down, and wordlessly defers to the rest of the group. Her eyes fixed on Asifa, Kail and Karantok.

  

Tranquil Pond

The lanky tabaxi comes forward to inspect the elf closely, making a slow turn around the man's back as he speaks softly.

  

Karantok moves over between Tranquil Pond and Bogs' side. It's still in battle mode, club in hand.

  

Tranquil moves. Karantok takes Bog's side instead.

Tranquil Pond

Condescending

I would be interested to hear how badly you need our help. And how you can make me wish to give it. I accept payment in secrets... or in amusement... in advance. Pond gives a disappointed shake of his head as he leans closer, well into the elf's personal bubble.

  

Orfan makes a concerned face.

Orfan: what...whatever it takes. If you need something taken care of from a distance, i'm your guy.

Orfan reaches back and taps his bow and arrow, holstered on his back, with his fingers. Still there.

  

Tranquil Pond

Condescending

No, no, no. You may have skills, but it appears listening is not among them.

  

He backs his face back a few inches from the Cat-Person's.

  

Groto sees the the man reaching for his bow.

Tense

Wooha, easy there.

  

The Selesnyan puts his hands back in the air.

Groto

Suspicious

I for one would feel much better if you people would drop your weapons.

  

The other three are 10ft (3m) behind the Selesnyan elf. No words are exchanged; only nervous looks.

  

Groto

Suspicious

Then we can talk about help...

  

Orfan: Of course.

  

Guys, your weapons.

The Selesnyan slowly takes his bow and arrow of his person right in front of Tranquil Pond. Soon after, Orfan drops his daggers to the ground as well.

The Half Elf in the back also complies... the other two follow suit.

Daggers, swords and crossbows lay on the floor a few feet away from their owners.

The Selesnyan is the only one with his hands up.

Nervous

  

Orfan: we did as instructed.

Versa slowly walks around the encounter, until she flanks the intruders' left side. Satisfied with their weapons dropped, she sheathes her rusty sword. Make no mistake, Vesra is still cautious to their actions.

  Orfan looks to the Male Tiefling who spoke earlier for a sign of acceptance.

Pond pulls back, rejoining his party, expression bored, his worlds cheerful. Do as you will with these newcomers; I have no interest.

Frisk
Sarcastic
Oh, thanks very nice of you...
So. Frisk is a Kalashtar but only when it comes to his feature his hair is white and eyes are green his complexion is pale and clear he often has on a tailored suit and is accompanied by a robotic dog named pon pon

  

Orfan gives an annoyed expression as the cat person walks away.

Vesra
...I'll be sure to keep an eye on you four.

  ...mind telling me your guys name before to judge me?

Tranquil Pond
Amused
Why would I do that?

Frisk
Friendly
13th Nov 2019
Because am real nice guy who know lots of nice tricks to make you and weapon better at doing what ever it is you want to do?

Tranquil Pond
Condescending
13th Nov 2019

You demonstrate nothing. It is only words and they bore me.

13th Nov 2019
 whispered to Frisk
Tranquil Pond is a very chaotic person, okay?

Frisk
13th Nov 2019
Frisk points at the robotic dog

 whispered to Frisk

The Leonin doesn't have a problem with you, that's just the character. Trust me, Tranquil Pond is a fun character to be with. You'll see.

Frisk

Nothing?!

Frisk

  

This is a non living being i created over like...a month?

  

Pond crouches to look at the dogbot. He puts out a hand and holds its head still while the legs keep trying to ambulate.

Condescending

Pfft. What entertainment does it provide.

Frisk

  

None? It's a protector? Like a guard dog?

  

Orfan: (*between his teeth) Frisk, what are you doing, bud. We need their help.

I'm not going another day eating berries and baby squirrels. They have a Viashino with them. Please, Frisk.

Frisk

Relax orfan am just talking to them? If we need there help so bad we should get friendly with them plus id love to be able to use a weapon around them with out getting stabbed.

Tranquil Pond

Condescending

I reiterate my point. However if my colleagues insist on accompanying you then you will have further opportunities to demonstrate your entertainment value.

Frisk

Playful

I know how to juggle want to see that?

Tranquil Pond

Condescending

Not particularly, no.

Frisk

Curious

14th Nov 2019

Will be quick friends i know it, how about any of you?

Groto

14th Nov 2019

Seeing the strangers lowering their weapons, Groto relaxes a bit.

Thats a good start...

 to Frisk

Suspicious

Gives us one reason to trust you people. Let alone be friends...

Frisk

14th Nov 2019

Honestly, because I can escape right now...and I have no other choice but to trust you, you act like am the bad guy, that am suspicious one but I dropped my weapons and am trying to get along with you guys and I don't see much a effort the other way.

Garreth

Pressing

14th Nov 2019

 to Frisk

"Friend" is an antiquated notion, it seems. We care not who you were in the Precincts. Who are you now?

Frisk

Annoyed

14th Nov 2019

God are you all just super unfriendly....look I just need help if tou don't want to fine I can go no need to do all this

Detached

Look am leveling with you Am a good guy I swear got in to a small town helped then out with my tech and moved on town went to shit I still have no idea why i just need help

Garreth

14th Nov 2019

 to Frisk

Friendship is of little import. We have been conditioned to question the motives of all who cross our paths. But we are not unaccepting. Prove yourself an ally, and you will have no trouble from us.

Frisk

Tired

14th Nov 2019

Cool I'll do that, but can we you know stop grilling me? Let me get my weapon so we can travel and I can find the opportunity to prove my self a ally?

Garreth

14th Nov 2019

 to Frisk

Arm yourself if you wish. You will surely need weapons to join us on our path, and if you instead stand against us, I would know of it sooner than later.

Frisk

14th Nov 2019

Uh-huh...so got any food on Ya? Am starved rabbits and berries is all we ate ill enchant...i don't know some armor for you or something.

Tranquil Pond

Condescending

14th Nov 2019

 to Frisk

I don't believe I have the pleasure of understanding you. Perhaps rephrase?

Frisk

14th Nov 2019

Easy...you give me food, I'll give you better armor.

Tranquil Pond

14th Nov 2019

Pond scoffs.

Amused

Armour! Do you hear this, Master Garreth?

Frisk

14th Nov 2019

So that's a no from you? Cool whatever no skin off my nose, look no need to get all haughty with me you take the deal or not that's your choice am just a hungry guy.

Tranquil Pond

Amused

14th Nov 2019

You will know when I am becoming haughty. This is merely light conversation.

Garreth

14th Nov 2019

 to Frisk

Steadfastness in purpose is my strongest defense. Knowledge and insight are far more valuable. What do you know of the turmoil in the precincts? Or of what awaits us in these wasted lands?

Frisk

Confused

14th Nov 2019

....ya am just a guy who got lost in the forest and is currently starving....i don't know what's going on with your stuff... But I would love some dried meat...or hard tac anything?

Tranquil Pond

Sarcastic

14th Nov 2019

Perhaps Master Kail will offer you some, in view of your request. He is very partial to people who ask.

Frisk

14th Nov 2019

Alright then.

Frisk picks up his weapons and straps it on. Him self

System

14th Nov 2019

The other elf in the back re arms himself. He approaches the human male with his hood on.

System

14th Nov 2019

Male Elf:... The name's Aratir. I was trained to hunt and kill monsters. Abominations of our world.

System

14th Nov 2019

Aratir: ... We've just met, but I think you and I will get along well.

Aratir gives Kail a smirk, then throws his hood back over his head and steps back with his group.

System

Apologetic

14th Nov 2019

Orfan: Frisk here is an Artificer. I was there when his village... well...

Orfan shoots Frisk a look.

Apologetic

Orfan: Not my place to say.

Orfan: Last but not least, our latest addition: Drachen.

The half elf in the back comes up to Orfan's side.

Orfan: Drachen just happened to be with us during the riot. Strength in numbers you know?

Orfan taps his arrows again and throws his bow around his shoulders.

Orfan: We're famished.

Do you folks have any food we could have? Rations?

Karantok

14th Nov 2019

Karantok approaches Orfan. It looks back to Tranquil Pond and Garreth for a signal of some sort. Seems Karantok wants to go out food searching for its new 'friends'.

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

14th Nov 2019

 to Karantok

Yes, buddy. They are hungry. Please find food.

Karantok

14th Nov 2019

Karantok's tongue darts in and out. Wordlessly he rushes out through the new party members and disappears into the treeline.

System

Suffering

Orfan: Oh, thank the gods.

Orfan finds a small boulder by the drawbridge to sit on.

Bogs Hothands

14th Nov 2019

I know I'm not shy of saying so, but let's take a break. Karantok will be back shortly and a fire will surely enhance the flavor of whatever he finds.

System

14th Nov 2019

The Selesnyan's sunken eyes become watery for a moment. His cheeks gaunt from lack of moisture.

Bogs Hothands

Friendly

14th Nov 2019

I'm Bogs, this is Asifa, Kail, Vesra, Groto, Pond, and Garreth. It seems you are not here to kill us. That's a plus in my book.

Bogs tosses his waterskin to Orfan.

System

14th Nov 2019

Orfan takes the bag and begins to drink it in a frenzy. One, two, gulps. Then he passes it along his comrades until it ends up back in his hands.

System

14th Nov 2019

Orfan: *sigh Thank you and your gods, dragonborn. There's a gulp or two left. We don't mean to take advantage.

Bogs Hothands

Curious

14th Nov 2019

Now, to the important matter... Any of you play any instruments?

'Asifa

14th Nov 2019

'Asifa, having seen enough of her companions playing with the new arrivals, gives Bogs a frown. She holds up her spear and displays the key that has been tied off on it. It continues to defy gravity and pull toward the castle.

Serious

Let's give these people some food so they have the energy to do what is needed. And what is needed is to goin there.

Garreth

14th Nov 2019

Garreth dutifully - and wordlessly - provides a day's worth of rations to each of the newcomers.

System

The half elf steps up and displays his viol.

14th Nov 2019

...about an hour passes.

Karantok the little lizard person returns, with 2 giant shell bugs and a 2ft (0.6m) giant centipede bug on it's shoulder.

By the time the little Viashino returned, there was already a stoked fire going, underneath a roofed horse stable structure by the drawbridge.

Karantok

14th Nov 2019

Karantok drops his haul of giant bugs at the feet of the party.

  

From its backpack, a swollen waterskin of water and a... moving burlap sack.

Admiring

Small bugs.

Kail

What's in the sack

14th Nov 2019

Karantok takes the moving bag and opens it for Kail to peer in.

14th Nov 2019

Several grasshoppers fly out.

  

Kail looks down into a box of various bugs. Grasshoppers, beetles, frogs, all writhing in the bag.

Karantok

Small bugs.

  

Bogs Hothands

to the half-elf Yes! This whole journey isn't all for naught. Please, tell me if you will join me for some tunes here by the fire.

  

Tranquil Pond

Oh, wonderful. A meal of insects and a rendition of the tankards song. My, my, this journey is turning out to be all sorts of fun, is it not.

  

The newcomers introduce themselves:

  

Tranquil Pond

... I will eat rations.

  

Groto

 to Tranquil Pond

Hey Pond, wanna see a trick?

Groto gets one of his rations out off his back and cast Prestidigitation to make it taste like the best roasted meat ever.

  

Groto

Playful

 to Tranquil Pond

Taste it.

  

Never one to pass up a free meal (especially one that looks like food), Pond accepts the rations and munches them. His eyes close and an involuntary purr of pleasure escapes his throat.

Relieved

... Finally, a person who knows the value of proper flavour. Keeper of Howard, you may prepare my meals in future.

Groto

Sarcastic

  

Wow, your personal food enhancer...I'm so honered.

  

It is mid day. A gentle breeze blows south.

  

The group sits in the area together, in front of the castle.

  

'Asifa's body and the key around her neck point straight to the castle. Her foot taps impatiently.

Vesra

  

Vesra looks to Asifa for this moment's guidance. The daemon Incubus Ansem gave her that key to help her somehow. As he did with these voices in Vesra's head.

It's only fitting that 'Asifa spearheads this exploration into the castle.

  

Vesra is ready to go when Asifa is.

Karantok

  

Karantok gets between Bogs and Tranquil Pond, as happy as ever with its darting, little tongue.

Karantok

Admiring

Eat!

  

Bogs Hothands

Cheerful

Alright Drachen one more before we're off. B double, E double R U N beer run

B double, E double R U N beer run

All we need is a ten and fiver

A car and key and a sober driver

B double, E double R U N beer run

  

Karantok offers both Bogs and Tranquil Pond a handful of bugs from its bag.

  

Drachen begins to bob his foot to Bogs' music.

Bogs Hothands

Bogs took notice of Groto's use of the spell that he knows himself. He accepts the bugs from Karantok and casts prestidigitation on them.

  

Groto, you've got something there. I must say, that works brilliantly.

  

Drachen

  

Drachen equips his viol and keeps tempo with Bogs' singing and drum beats.

  

It's quite harmonious and energetic.

Bogs Hothands

Cheerful

  

 to Drachen

You were great on the Viol newcomer! I will play music with you anytime.

  

The little gig is enough to make some willing party members clap their hands and move a little.

  

Karantok copies the party, but seems to lack musicality. It stumbles about like a toddler.

After a minute, the jig ends.

Drachen bows his head.

Tranquil Pond

14th Nov 2019

Meanwhile, Pond has flicked all of the dead grasshoppers off his hand, leaving only the live ones. He allows them to hop into the air, then, quick as a whip, catches them. It becomes something of a game until he impatiently stuffs them into his mouth all at once.

Groto

 to Bogs Hothands

  

Cheers

Howard gets out of the coat and starts hunting grasshoppers.

Tranquil Pond

  

 to OrfanDrachenAratir Nightbranch

You. Other newcomers. Are you all as desperate for help as your fellow here? I reiterate, I offer aid in exchange for secrets or amusement.

  

Pond's eye cannot help but follow the flowing movement of the weasel as his head tilts and his eyes grow wide.

  

Groto

to Tranquil Pond

Dude...

  

Tranquil Pond

...Hm?

  

Groto

Don't look at him like that...

  

A slow smile crosses the tabaxi's face.

Like what, keeper of Howard?

  

Groto just stares at Pond with a face that says "Don't go there"

Tranquil Pond

  

The expression Pond returns to Groto is exaggeratedly bland and innocent. He makes a big shrug of his shoulders.

  

'Asifa would like to join in with the others - their banter and maybe their bugs. No, not the bugs. But she's got only one thing on her mind. She stands up and begins walking to the castle gate.

You all ready and willing? If not, maybe I'll see you after I see what's in there.

She stops only briefly to look back and see how the others respond.

  

Tranquil Pond

Oh, not to worry, Mistress 'Asifa. Exploring a castle seems far more entertaining than sitting out here consuming insects.

Pond draws himself up and moves to stand with 'Asifa. He gives Groto another knowing smile as he walks past the tiefling.

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs catches the not-so-subtle gestures from his companions. He slowly rises to his feet stretching each and every joint on his way up.

  

Ahhhlllrighty then. To the castle! Can I sing? Or are we creepin’?

  

Tranquil Pond

... We are most definitely creepin'.

  

Vesra

We don't know what's down there. Except for whatever the voices warn me about.

Creep now, sing songs of our survival later.

Vesra takes to Asifa's side.

  

Groto

Creep is my middle name. Lets go.

Wait. That came out wrong...

  
  

Groto joins the others

Frisk dose does not care he gets enough so he won't starve then goes to start doing some improvements with pon

  

Aratir Nightbranch

Aratir will check to make sure his crossbow is in working order before we start creepin.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond suddenly gives out a subdued, feline fnsssshhh of a sneeze. If the party looks down they note that the shadows cling a little closer to their bodies and their footprints are no longer visible, as though they might Pass Without Trace through the unfamiliar castle.

Bogs Hothands

14th Nov 2019

Bogs looks up towards Pond with a nod.

Frisk

Cheerful

14th Nov 2019

Will that useful.

For those of you who haven't talked to me the name is frisk, I don't bite hopefully one of your are more friendly then the others.

Bogs Hothands

Oh, enemies? You have enemies? Did you discover some compromising information about them? Double-cross them in a high-stakes gamble? Insult their parentage?

  
  

# Chapter 11: With the Gruul

Through the exhaustion, a grin appears on Bogs’ face “I think I need to find a place to sleep.”

  

Jezean "You can stay in my tent. I wanna hear more about your old band. Celtie, you come along too." Jezean pulls at the Half Elf's bass guitar.

  

Pond gives Bogs an arch look, glancing at the two women, but says nothing.

  

Celtie "What about this one? He hasn't answered me yet." *Celtie's gaze is focused on Drachen.

  

Bogs feel a tug of energy. His eyes widened “Is that so? Well let me tell you about the time...” He glances back at Pond with a surprised look

  

Pond makes a go-on gesture, twirling a finger.

  

Jezean "NOW, Celtie." Celtie "I'll catch up. Mr. Mysterious over here playing it cool intrigues me." Jezean "Ugghhh. Fine. Come, Bogs." Jezean once again readjusts herself, just now deciding to display her true strength as she semi-carries Bogs away into the night.(edited)

  

With a laugh, Pond moves away to find a space to set up his hammock, far enough away from anyone else as to have a semblance of solitude.

  

. Three unintroduced members of the mercenary band look to Jezean and Bogs as the Dragonborns walk out of the crowd. Talah speaks up.

  

. Talah "Bed already? You guys are gonna miss the event."

  

. Talah "What about you guys?" She looks to @Garreth [RG] , @'Asifa [Ithinkiam], @Kail [gmouser], and @Vesra [Ny4nk0 ] . "You haven't said much since we got together."

frisk continues to work on pon

  

Kail

"I'm just enjoying my drink. Been a while since I could. Don't mind me"

  

'Asifa

"I wasn't under the impression that we came here to socialize. My mind is set to get back in the city." 'Asifa closes her eyes for a moment and lets out a small sigh. "Forgive me. I am a woman of practical action. I don't mean to come across as a total bore. But nothing I have seen here so far has gotten me one step closer to my goals."

  

Garreth 

To Talah: "I admit, hedonistic displays are no longer in my repertoire. There is much to unpack from this assembly of revelers, both in their comportment and my own reaction to it. You are a woman of certain traditions, it seems. How did you come to be among these folks?"

  

Kail

"I'm just here as a favor for a friend, you all decided to stick around."

  

Talah Looks at @Garreth [RG] with a smirk, then changes to a serious face "Clears throat Ahem... Yes, yes, The stars aligned myself and group here: Amongst the savages and cannibals to make a difference. In their presence, the ability to transmorph oneself into higher being, higher state of mind."

  

... "I'm fucking with you, tiger. Cap said we're doing an escort mission, so we're here. Simple as that."

  

.Talah looks at Kail.

"Have you met the cap yet? Something about you makes me think you'd both get along. That sneaky air about the both of you."

  

. A man approaches from behind Talah. He places his hand on Talah's shoulder.

  

. Talah "Oh, hey Merlin. You meet our new friends?"

  

. Merlin is a good looking human male with shaggy brown hair and a grey cloak that ends around his midsection, hiding his arms. He leans on Talah comfortably, much to Talah's annoyance. Although the crowd is quite noisy, the party hears...ticking? the sound of whirring, clicking and sliding metals emanating from Merlin.(edited)

  

. Merlin *A cheerful smile over his face as he looks to @'Asifa [Ithinkiam] * "Everyone. Charmed." *Merlin makes brief eye contact with every party member present, then gives a small bow as acknowledgement. He turns to @'Asifa [Ithinkiam] * "I get where you're coming from, white hair. I too have a goal, and every second fucking around with strangers is time wasted. At least at first glance. You can be a young soldier, eager to kill something on the front lines and storm the castle for glory. OR you can be a commander, synchronize tactics with other allies of the kingdom you fight for. Take the time to understand the lay of the land and use them to your advantage to minimize loss and improve efficiency." Merlin pauses "I say this because one can never be sure of how their resources present themselves. A new friend could be more useful than magic armor. I pray that you see your advantages for what they are." Merlin looks to the party, awaiting a reaction.

  

. Talah "My gods, Merlin, you always get like this when you're drunk." Merlin Still looking at 'Asifa "Written on paper, scribbled in stone; Truth is Truth, no matter the delivery."

. Talah "Ugh. Just speak normal, Merlin."

'Asifa nods as Merlin speaks. "I can't deny that no one makes it far on their own in this world. But friendship is earned is it not? If any of prove trustworthy and can help us get back in the 10th, you can consider yourself well on your way."

Merlin nods.

'Asifa

"Speaking of which, when will we be on our way?"

  

Frisk

"Hopefully soon I need to get some supplies some can build more stuff...getting antsy not having stuff to work on."

  

Talah "The convoy's tomorrow morning. We should be in the Tenth in a day or so."

  

Noticing the group has not broken up as he had expected, Pond wanders back toward the congregation. "Is it not time for sleep? I do not speak for the rest of you, but I for one am exhausted."

  

He casts a glance at @Frisk [Arken]. "Tired already of upgrading your... pet? Such a pity."

I haven't talked to you in a day and...it was...a really nice day no more tails to chase?, and no I never bore of my good buddy but I need supplies to continue

  
  

Though they're about the same height, Pond retains his lazy, slouching posture as he tilts his head at a condescending angle toward the artificer. "No, I agree, a day without talking to you is a day of joy. And my appetites are sated... for now. Do I detect a hint of jealousy? I guarantee my bedmate was far more enjoyable than your little ghost would be." He smirks as he plays with his chosen prey.

  

frisk didn't wait for a response from pond as he already walked away sketching into a book

  
  

Pond shrugs as he turns away from the other man. "At least he knows when he is beaten. Now, what is it we are doing this evening?"

  

Merlin "Shh. The event's starting." The beat of giant drums slowly stir up. The beat slowly drags from pianissimo into a forte, stopping the small talks within the crowd.

  
  

Turns and looks towards the center.

The ettin from earlier stands in the center of the crowd, looking down. It beats at its chest in rhythm with the drums. Giants and Viashino join in, one by one.

  

Kail

Perks up and looks around at the others, to see if anyone else is not joining in

  

The sea of Gruul is a mess: staggering about and fighting each other. But upon see their leader beating their chest in silence, they sober up and join proper.

  

From what Kail sees, it's only a matter of time until the entire horde joins in.

  

"Talah," Pond raises his voice over the drumming. "What is happening?" He does not lose his composure, instead calmly awaiting an answer like a monarch.

  

Talah 

"This is what they do. A kind of solidarity kinda thing." 

The chest thumps get louder. Soon, most if not all the clans have joined in the chest beating.

  
  

. The ettin does one last beat of its chest, with such force that the ground rumbles. The drums have stopped. A kind of silence over the camp that one could hear a pin drop.

  

One of the heads of the ettin speaks up with a voice like mixing gravel. . Ettin "...GRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLL" The clansmen join in the ettin's howling. It takes only a wave of the ettin's hand to make it all silent again.

  

. The head with the missing tusks beats his side of his chest and speaks: Ruric "...RURIC.." then he slaps the other head, causing the other head to yell out. Ruric "...HIM THAR" Together, the two heads beat their sides of the chest in unison. "RURIC. THAR. RURIC THAR. RURIC THAR."""

  

. The ettin seems to know no volume other than silence, grunts or bellowing yelling. Thar "GRUUL. STRONG. ERM... FIRE! FIRE BURN! PAIN! FEEL!"

Bogs Hothands

@Kail [gmouser] “I’m not so sure Pond will be interested, but it’s worth a shot.”

  

Kail

Then let's drop by, before we visit @Vesra's place

  

Tranquil Pond

Finally, Pond returns with cup in hand and weasel intact. He hands both unceremoniously to Groto. "... So, what did I miss?"

  

Groto
"Ah, thank you my friend."

  He pads him on the shoulder while trying to sneak the charm in to Pond's pockets.

Bogs Hothands

@Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle] “Your advances were not in vain, my fluffy friend. Brooke left you a send off. She wished to give it to you personally.” Bogs bats his eyes

Groto

"Ah yes, the gift. Now where did I put it?" Groto takes his time searching through all his pockets, trying to annoy Bogs for ruining the surprise.(edited)  

"Oh right! I gave it to my servant!" He winks at Pond.

Tranquil Pond

Pond just stares at Groto for a moment, scowling. "I am so glad you amuse yourself."

Bogs Hothands makes a Perception check!
1d20 (16) + 0 = 16

Bogs Hothands

@Groto [TheFolk] “What, I thought Pond was your servant. For today anyways. Who did you give it to, you flea bitten greasball?”

Groto

"But seriously, check your pockets. You girlfriend left you an invitation to come and meet her at her place."

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/03/2020

@Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle] “He is supposed to give you something.”

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/03/2020

Pond feels around in his clothing, eventually producing the small wooden charm. "... What is this? Not the key to her apartment..." He sounds a little surly.

Bogs Hothands

“She said it is a charm, in honor of her deity. You might want to visit this shrine. Bogs hands Pond the parchment with directions to the shrine. She thought you may experience an awakening. Bogs dazzles his hands in the air. she though you might be interested in a divine cat lover deity or something.”

  
Tranquil Pond 

The monk curls his lip contemptuously. "What, an awakening to the pure rubbish that is belief in a higher power? Not to worry, I have that well in hand."


11:28 AM

]

He takes the parchment to look it over. "... Well, I suppose it will be a diversion to visit at some point." He folds the parchment and wraps it around the charm.

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/03/2020

“That’s my translation. She made it sound much more alluring. Either way, I think she likes you.”(edited)

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/03/2020

"... And?"

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/03/2020

“And...”

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/03/2020

Pond twirls his hand in a go-on gesture.

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/03/2020

“Well, I don’t think she’s ready to jump your bones... yet... but maybe if you jump though these hoops, she may trust your intentions enough to.. I don’t know. I’m not exactly a love expert.” Bogs wrenches his neck sideways “She made an effort to seek you out before you left. That’s something right.”

  

Tranquil Pond 

"You assume I have any intention of prolonging the acquaintance beyond the forced interactions of those who travel together." Pond shrugs broadly, arms open wide. "It was an oddity, I grant you. Although..." He pauses. "I may be interested in figuring out how these two groups came to mirror each other so closely." Pond falls silent as his gaze follows Bogs'. After a moment, he takes a big breath in and begins walking. "So, we leave?"

  

Bogs Hothands 

“Do you not seek a deeper relationship with a special someone. Brook need not be the one, but she could be.” passionate

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond beckons to the dragonborn as he keeps walking. "Do you not feel whole in yourself? Why chain yourself to another being, when the world is full of them?" he asks detachedly.

  

Groto

"I think you two would make beautiful kittens."

  

Bogs Hothands

“More like a two headed jackal.”

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond throws a rude gesture over his shoulder while he walks away. "We are leaving now."

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs scowls as his friend bounds out of earshot @Groto [TheFolk] “Would you believe this? He tries with all his might to seduce this poor girl. Now that she finally shows an interest, he turns a cold shoulder.”

  

Groto

"Chasing something and catching it but not knowing what to do with it...sounds like a cat to me."

  

Bogs Hothands

“Hmm. I guess you’re right. I never thought about it like that...” Bogs’ words drift off as he ponders the thought.

  

Garreth 

Garreth will have spent time poring over the APBs looking for familiar (or infamous) faces. He is curious if the new activity is somehow tied together, or if the crumbling foundation of Ravnican order is simply allowing the chaotic, sadistic ways of the Raakdos to shine through more clearly.

  

@'Asifa [Ithinkiam] reviews the hand gestures Merlin made. Seems he was wishing her well with her goals in finder better equipment.

  

. @Garreth [RG] reads through the Bulletins. Looking at the dates, it seems the Rakdos Riots have been growing in frequency. Some of these APBs are actually people in high society who have gone missing. Kidnapped from their homes in the chaos of the night.

  

. Carnival workers, politicians, community leaders, scientists, supposed terrorists; The list of missing and wanted persons go on and on.

  

. . . One bulletin catches @Garreth [RG]'s eye. A missing person's notice. The owner of a clothing shop. A large Leonin with white and light brown fur, with specks of white fur around his face. His eyes are a ghostly pale blue, contrasted by a warm smile that oozes confidence. He looks similar to @Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle], but not quite.(edited)

Garreth takes the notice of the missing Leonin with him as he passes. As he catches up to the group, he motions @Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle] aside and presents tre posting.

  

"Related to your cloning theories? Or is this resemblance the result of something more natural?"

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond reads over the notice, sighing as he offers it back to Garreth. "Well, this day grows more and more interesting." He pauses, meeting the other man's direct, intense stare with a rueful smile. "My cousin."

  

The notice was posted 3 weeks ago.

  

Tranquil Pond

"I shall need to make enquiries in Precinct Two." As Garreth takes back the notice, Pond turns around with a shake of the head and returns to the rest of the party.

  

Groto

Groto walks up to the board, looking for any interesting jobs.

  

Kail 

"I suggest you all check your homes to see if they still stand and haven't been ransacked."

  

"If you wish to meet up to do anything else, then we can do here at midday"

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/04/2020

Pond yawns broadly at the statement, rough tongue lolling out. "Oh, thank you for that astute observation. I am certain none of us would have thought of checking had you not been here to organise us. I am not available to come when you bid me... What was your name again? Never mind." His tone is sarcastic and exaggerated.

Kail [gmouser]03/04/2020

Looks over at Pond, "What you're sober? At this hour? I'm shocked."

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/04/2020

It's hard to tell whether the feline chuckle is tinged with a purr or a growl. "Surely you can do better than that."

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe0_WkC39Dcd2dBrVL8icXhNzbVb0eiNo4WHn6Hhi7jMvhxEwFGyZel6-RLbeo4TbmwBdwbZGmyb6vrmAW3jwehEW1CS4mDg4x2qJN80mszXJpWIlMuy860fpDl0CLBbX1BjabIs_nuq_t0ABnnayzkIcye?key=twOZZfRHoV7T8K23gabWBg)

Kail [gmouser]03/04/2020

"Oh you're still talking?"

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/04/2020

"Only to fill the silence created by all the head shaking and sighing, fellow." Hands on hips, Pond raises his chin to meet the other man's eyes. "And to remind you that you are not in charge here."

  

Groto

"Servant, be quite. I'm trying to read."

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond drops his voice to a whisper. "Fine. Upstart."

  

Kail

Laughs deeply

  

Bogs Hothands 

Bogs hears the word sober, and tries to remember the last time he had a drink. oh yes back at the tavern, before that horrendous trek... “Who’s up for a drink? Kail? Garreth? Asifa? Groto? Howard... I know you could use one.” Bogs looks over at Pond “Oh come on, you too buddy..”

  

Tranquil Pond

"Apparently I am a drunk whose sobriety is a novelty, so I will abstain," Pond whispers irritably.(edited)

  

Kail Laughing, "Of course! Lead the way"

  
  

Looking around, the closest bar is the one which they went to, shortly after meeting Groto, by the market stalls.

  

Bogs Hothands

The sight of the tavern causes images of that hazy evening... or was it morning... to flash into Bogs’ noggin.

  

“Did I make an ass of myself? I hope they let me in. Oh well, let’s go.” Bogs pats Pond on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. If there will be a noticeable drunk present, it surely will be me.”

  

Bogs Hothands

“Who is with me?” Bogs moves towards the establishment while checking for followers.

  

Kail

follows @Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes] as he heads to the tavern(edited)

  

Tranquil Pond 

Pond lags behind sullenly but does come along.

  

Groto [TheFolk]03/04/2020

Groto, who is still standing at the notice board, looks up and sees everyone leaving.

"Hey! hold up!" He quickly follows them.

  
  

Bogs Hothands

Happy to see his friends following, Bogs enters the bar, approaches the counter, and calls for a round of ale

  

Bogs Hothands

to the barkeep “Good day to you. I hope my first impression, whether tarnished or spit clean, can be made whole on this fine day. A round of hearty ale for my friends here.”

  
  
  

The bar is spacious, with enough barrels and boxes to sit on to accommodate about 50 people. it's cramped .... Almost at full capacity. The party carefully navigates through. Passing by, the party notices that these patrons don armor and sheathe weapons while heartily drinking. They've all got shoddy accessories made from stone, black spikes. Laughs and smiles aplenty here. Barkeep "Huh? Wassat? First impression? Uhhhh yeah, the dragonbaby from a few weeks back, I think. Yeah, yeah, Ale on the way. MOM"

  

. Finding a table with 8 seats, the group gets cozy as soon as the ale arrives.

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/05/2020

Pond looks about to observe the racial makeup of the bar patrons, making brazen eye contact with anyone who glances his way as he takes note of them.

  
  

It's a mixed bag of races common in society. Humans, elves, loxodons and minotaurs. Vedalkens, goblins... merfolk? And one creature that looks to be a mix between an elf and a crab.

  

. One notable patron is... an ethereal being. This creature sits at the bar facing the barkeep. It's like a fog taking the shape of a humanoid in a cloak. It's constantly evaporating at the feet. It makes eye contact with @Pond. Pale eyes devoid of life blankly stare back. It's a ghost.

  

. One other patron dares to stare back at the Leonin Monk. A goblin who had captured the attention of its goblin friends. As soon as it makes eye contact with @Pond, it stops drinking and alerts it friends. Pond meets the gaze of 4 little goblinfolk.

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond ignores the ghost. He wiggles his fingers in a cheeky little wave at the goblins.

  

The goblins snarl at each other in the harshest of noises, as what their language is known for. A moment of staring passes. They turn back to each other and resume drinking.

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]03/05/2020

With a shrug, Pond turns back to the rest of his party.

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/05/2020

as the drinks are being poured Bogs attempts his best falsetto “What’s the story friend. This place is more packed than I remember.”(edited)

  
  

Barkeep's Mom "You're not part of this lot? Hmm, suppose not. Short the horn tips."

  

. "Rakdos business, y'see. The protectors need all the help they can get. The green, the blue, the Boros; all the lot."

  

. "So they took to outsourcin'. Pay's so good even the scum o' the district's been out lookin' for the deamon worshippers."(edited)

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/05/2020

Bogs resorts back to his normal voice “Oh yea? Do you know who the recruiters are? I know a couple peeps who may be interested. Also, does one need to reserve a spot for music playing and the like? I’m always trying to toot my horn, if you know what I mean.”

  
  

Barkeep's Mom "No recruiters, just attack them Rakkie Deamons on sight. See them horn tips everyone's got around their necks? They fetch for 5 gold a piece. That's a set of leather armor, right there for a two horned beast. Give 'em to any high rank Azorius. "(edited)

  
  

“Is it hard to cash them in? Seems they are wearing them more like a badge of honor.”

  
  

Barkeep's Mom "Those horns? Around their necks? Puny. The bigger the deamon, the bigger the horn, the bigger the pay."

  

. "They're just showing off to their gang buddies, nothing serious."

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]03/05/2020

“Thanks for the info and drinks?” Bogs slides her a few coin and returns to his friends goblets in hand.

  

speaking to the party members “Sooo... before I serve you all some liquid courage, let’s talk about revenge.”(edited)

  

“See those pairs of horns dangling from every scaly, hairy, and scrawny neck in this room? Word is, Azorius are paying top coin for each pair, harvested from a Rakdos cultist. As much as it turns my stomach, I don’t feel bad for them.”(edited)

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond sniffs, still sulking a little. "Revenge is such a dull impulse. And when we say top coin what are we talking about?"

  

Groto

Groto is suddenly very conscious off his horns and looks around the room to see how people react to him.

  

Some of the patrons stare at @Groto, going so far as to brandish their blades. Other patrons stop them from taking action with a shake of the head and a tug of their clothes.

  

Groto 

"Uhm...guys..."(edited)

  

He looks at @Vesra and then back to the others. "Might I suggest an other place to get a drink...?"(edited)

March 6, 2020

  

Vesra [Ny4nk0 ]Last Friday at 6:13 AM

"I don't think they know who they are facing." Belligerent she states at one of the shady guys and puts a streak of get hair behind her horns. A grin shows her sharp teeth.

  

Vesra makes an Intimidation check!

1d20 (15) + 3 = 18

  

Groto

Groto tries to do the same. Groto makes an Intimidation check!

1d20 (2) + 4 = 6

  
  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Friday at 6:36 AM

“Horns. Right. How could I forget. We should probably find a hat for you two. Streets won’t be any safer.”

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Friday at 6:55 AM

Bogs stands back up, gives the onlookers a scowl worthy of a dragon, and then approaches the bar once again.

  
  

Bogs Hothands makes an Intimidation check!

1d20 (18) + 5 = 23

  
  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Friday at 6:57 AM

to the barkeep’s mom “Madam. I have one more request. Do you have any hats for sale?”

  
  

@Vesra bats her wings and hisses to reveal her canines. @Bogs growls and slams his tail on the ground. @Groto tries to look menacing by copying the other tiefling, only to appear mentally injured as he shakes wings he doesn't have while biting his upper lip. This causes the staring patrons to avert their gazes and take a step back.(edited)

  

. Barkeep's Mom "Oh dear! Yes, just... we don't want any trouble. Here: there's a few hats in the lost and found." She's notably tense when she fetches a small wooden box for the group. Inside is a few hats, mismatched sheepskin gloves, wooden and metal knick-knacks and a bent dagger.

  

Groto 

"Ha! They are sooo scared of us."

  

In the box is a top hat, a little torn at the top. It's more than enough to hide a tiefling's horns.

  

Groto sees the hat and grabs it.

He puts it on.

"How do I look"?

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Friday at 10:17 AM

before Bogs can assure the woman he means no harm to her, he is surprised by Groto’s eager snag of the top hat.

  

“Um... like a politician? It’s great...”

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Friday at 10:29 AM

Bogs picks a hat from the remains and hands the box back to the woman. whispering “Please don’t fear me. My lot in life is in music, not barbarism.”

  

Bogs short tosses the hat to @Vesra [Ny4nk0 ]

  

DMLast Friday at 10:44 AM

The Barkeep's mom nods nervously.

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Friday at 8:39 PM

Pond eyes the two behatted party members. "You are aware those are from the lost and found? Who knows whose head might have been in there previously."

  

Groto [TheFolk]Last Friday at 9:53 PM

Groto does not seem to listen.(edited)

  

"Howard, got you a room with a view."

  

The weasel, who was sleeping inside the coat, climbs to Groto's shoulder. He sniffs the new hat and after a moment lifts it a bit with his snout and crawls inside. He sticks his head out of the tare in the top and gives a satified little squik.(edited)

  

"I knew you would like it."

  

Vesra [Ny4nk0 ]Last Friday at 10:10 PM

"Don't worry! I've checked and the head of the previous owner isn't in there anymore"

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Friday at 10:16 PM

Pond shrugs, tilting his head back and looking off into the middle distance. "Suit yourselves. I am sure the lice will also enjoy their new home." He pauses. "Now, @Bogs, there was talk of some liquid courage?"

March 7, 2020

  

Garreth [RG]

Garreth frowns at the Barkeep's mom. "Mercenaries? Do they have a leader?"

  

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Saturday at 4:36 AM

“Yes, courage in the form of ale, and not that head splitting stuff that the Gruul brew.” Bogs disperses one to each of his companions, and then lifts his glass in preparation of a toast.(edited)

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Saturday at 5:38 PM

Pond waits to hear what Bogs has to say before raising his tankard.

March 8, 2020

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Sunday at 4:42 AM

“One more adventure for the books. Now here we are back in the tenth with all ten fingers and toes in tact. Were the mirrors of ourselves even real or a figment of our imagination, the result of a lack of nourishment and over exertion? Perhaps it was all a Dream...“ Bogs pauses for moment before gathering himself “It began in the coliseum. Though the circumstances were dire, we emerged together as one, out of the darkness. I don’t know why, but this is where we find ourselves. Let the gods sort it out. We need to cut our own path now. Stake our own lot. Show the bloody leeches that we have pride, power, and won’t take shit from nobody! I am lucky to have each of you in my life. Now, let’s drink to us. To surviving!”(edited)

Groto [TheFolk]Last Sunday at 4:47 AM

Groto raises his tankard. “To surviving…” he says with a small voice. For him this adventure did not start at the coliseum but at this very inn. It’s strange to be here again. He remembered how he first met these people and how they became…friends? At the least companions and that’s something. He wish he had met these people on different circumstances.

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Sunday at 4:55 AM

Pond raises his own mug with a lazy grin. "... And to the pleasures that life has to offer."

  

Vesra [Ny4nk0 ]Last Sunday at 2:40 PM

With a raised tankard Vesra adds "... And to those who can't drink with us anymore!"

  

Frisk [Arken]Last Sunday at 5:27 PM

*frisk walks in to room and settles down on the table with his traveling companions looking at them raising tankards he picks up a cup of water * "To whatever you guys just said."

March 9, 2020

  

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Monday at 3:55 AM

After quaffing some of his tankard, Pond puts it on the table with a thump and rises quickly from his chair. "Well, as diverting as this all is, I have business to attend to." He nods to @Garreth. "I will catch up with you later. Where will you be at dusk?" Stretching, he addresses this last to the entire party.(edited)

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs takes a long swig of his brew “Ahh, yes. Now that’s ale friends.” @Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle] “So, what is this business you speak of?” Bogs’ tone pretends to be uninterested(edited)

  

Tranquil Pond

"It is nothing really. My cousin may be in a spot of trouble and I intend to make enquiries." Pond is equally nonchalant.

  

Bogs Hothands

“Oh... cool. I hope they are ok.” “So you don’t want to check out the shrine thing? Maybe after?”(edited)

  

Tranquil Pond

The whiskered eyebrows raise. "Why would I do that?"(edited)

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs looks disappointed once again, but doesn’t push his point a across this time “No... reason. Just curious.”

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond smiles lazily at his friend. "If this is about the girl you may forget it. Or do you fear for my soul?"

  

Bogs Hothands

“If you don’t go, I will.” “But not right now. I have things to do too. Roommates to check on...” “We should meet at a central location. Maybe somewhere on Tin street.”(edited)

Tranquil Pond [foodpoodle]Last Monday at 3:47 PM

"Why would you go?" Pond scrunches up his lips a little in suspicion.(edited)

Bogs Hothands [Thornytoes]Last Monday at 4:32 PM

“Hmm.. maybe to follow up on Brook’s first act of faith on your part. Maybe to see if she would be right for you. Stand her up now, and you can forget any chance of winning her heart. Yes, I am worried about your soul. I’m worried you’ll be an old washed up Tom cat without family or friends, looking for the next kitty kitty on the corner!”

  

1

  

Tranquil Pond

At the mention of family Pond draws himself up to go nose-to-nose with Bogs. His eyes are suddenly hard, his tone dangerous. "You know nothing of my family so do not assume you know what is best for me." And in a blink he is back to his languid demeanour. "Besides, I have no interest in winning a woman's heart. However, I will go with you, if only to spare you making a fool of yourself." He pauses now with a smile, reaching up to pat Bogs on the cheek. "Not to worry. Washed-up is a matter of perspective."

  

Bogs Hothands

Bogs goes wide eyed as Pond squares up, challenging his accusation. “Sorry, that was off base.” He composes himself when Pond retreats, and then raises an eyebrow as Pond pats his cheek. “Umm. Sure. I’m glad you’ll join me. And for the record, I don’t think you’re washed up... yet.” Bogs gives Pond a returning smile

  

Tranquil Pond

Pond waves a dismissive hand as he turns to walk out. "I will find you later. Tin Street, yes? Precinct Two."

  

Bogs Hothands

“Wait... there’s a tavern in Griffin Heights called the Cursed Hammer. You can find me there. That goes for all of you. I’m heading out after this mug.”

  

Groto

"Hey @Bogs, would you mind if I tag along? I don't really have anywhere to go but I was planning on visiting inn's to ask about possible work. And I don't think its wise to be alone right now..."

March 10, 2020

  

Kail

Finishes his drink, and then flags down a waitress. "My cat friend will be right back, can you keep this table for him when he gets back. I need to use the facilities. I think he'll likely want another drink too, just put this on his tab."

He then ducks out the back towards the jakes.  
  
Frisk [Arken

firsk will get up and start looking for that hidden base of that artificer that created the flying castle hell start by asking vendors that sell artificer tools and showing designs of the automaton seeing if it will lead any where  
  
Garreth

Garreth watches Tranquil Pond depart, then follows behind at a short distance  
  
'Asifa [Ithinkiam]

'Asifa follows Frisk out.

"A goal oriented man. After my own heart I tell you."

  

The party temporarily disbands, leaving @Vesra at the table with @Kail just returning from the jakes (restroom). There's still enough time to catch up to the other party members.

  

# Chapter 14A Pond and Garreth

# Chapter 14B Bogs and Groto

# Chapter 14C Frisk and ‘Asifa

Of course there are to many questions without answers right now, and that's really annoying @'Asifa [Ithinkiam]

.

.

.

  

@Frisk and @'Asifa walk the streets, asking the vendors about the diagrams in the book

  

Vendor "Hmmm... looks rather complex. I'm just a merchant, maybe you'll have better luck asking in Precinct Five, in the Ismeri Library.

  

Frisk leafs through the pages of his notes.

  

Flying Castle Requirements

1: Mana source

2: Three Turbine Engines

3: Two shipments of large metal parts (Shafts, large gears, manifolds, etc.)

4: Four shipments of small metal parts ( small gears, nuts, bolts, etc)

5: Rubber parts (hoses, belts, etc.)

6: 11 Mana batteries

7: Two shipments of mana transfer wires

8: Blueprints (Either original or reverse engineered)

.

Shelby's missing Automaton parts

-Left Eye

-Both hands

-Right leg

  

Archway Activation

-Soul of a planeswalker

.

@'Asifa clutches the drained soul gem. The soul of a planeswalker. That's all she needs to see her family one more.

  

The precinct five got it thank you for the help, so asifa where going to head there but before all that...am interested in knowing, a lot of the party aren't interested in this so....why are you?

  

"It seems to me that the same people who can help you understand Sheby and that castle can also help me find a planeswalker. And don't forget about my shield either!"

"So, shall we head to the library?"

  

I won't forget the shield I just need tools and money...and time... To work on it, is let us go to the library...i believe it's this way....maybe?

  

he shrugs and starts walking

'Asifa

"I haven't been there. I've had little patience for books and research to be honest. Never had a use for it. And I don't mind asking for directions along the way."

'Asifa follows Frisk to Precinct 5.

Frisk

I think will be okay with out directions...but still your not planning to like...follow me around in till I have all my research complied then make that thing for you, then you kill me and take all my stuff?

'Asifa

'Asifa is confused for a second. "I'm sticking with you because you'll be of help in getting that portal open again. Some magic shield is nothing to me compared to finding those people we saw while the portal was open. My people."

  

Frisk pauses for a moment his head now pounding thinking about his family and how is race just doesn't exist and he turns to asifa

  

Your people...you know what...you hit me in a soft spot...ill help you find your people no matter the cost, just cover my back and I'll cover yours, pon got  you too.

  

pon barks happily

  
  

In order to get to Ismeri library, the researchers cut through the Blistercoils.

  

The Blister Coils

"A series of gigantic waterwheels, built and operated by the Izzet League, turns just outside Novijen in the north end of Precinct Five. The system generates magical energy to power public works, Simic laboratories, and Izzet workshops. Few outside the Izzet realize that the amount of energy generated in the Blistercoils exceeds what is actually used, with the excess stored in underground batteries that could explode if they became overloaded.

Blistercoils is also the name of the neighborhood near the waterwheels, which largely consists of workshops and private laboratories."

.

There are very few citizens about as @'Asifa and @Frisk walk through the streets. The entrances of the buildings are either secured by gigantic metal doors or guarded by odd mechanical creatures. One notable sentry is a creature that seems to be made of electricity and water. The occasional Boros soldier strolls by.

  

'Asifa's curiosity is piqued by the strange sentry and strolls up closer to take a look. Is it apparent what sort of building it is guarding?

  

Wings made of water and the constant release of zzzttt ztt sounds emanate from this mechanoid creature. It stares at @'Asifa, making no movement.

  

"Endar's Experiments" is written in large print overhead. Upon Asifa's proximity, the sign changes to "Closed due to the fucking carnies wrecking shit".

  

'Asifa waves @Frisk [Arken] over. "What do you think of this? Remarkable, no? Maybe this Endar could be useful to us."

  

The Automaton aims its body at the two party members. Its mask looks to be made of ceramic. It doesn't seems to need it. Despite its humanoid appearance, it could very well be just sentient electricity. Just one marvel of the infamous Izzet League.

  

'Asifa decides she at least has to try to knock on the door. She walks up and dies just that.

  

Asifa approaches.

  

The mechanoid emits a howling, groaning sound, like the creaking of a ship at sea. It raises its arm(?) and impedes Asifa from getting to the door.

  

Electric Mechanoid

GrooOOOOOooooonnn.

  

'Asifa smiles. "Well aren't you diligent. Very well, upsetting you is likely no way to ingratiate your maker. @Frisk [Arken] , maybe we can stop by here again on the way back. Shall we head to the library?"

  

Frisk

....i never said this before but I want to see what that is made from...but ya the library.

  

The mechanoid resumes its position, staring blankly ahead as @Frisk mutters something about its weird design.

.

.

.

Walking past Hightower and Prism University, the two finally arrive at the Library.

  

Ismeri Library

"One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of thousands of books covering every conceivable subject are found here."

  

Frisk

"Okay you ready to get in there and maybe look for a long hidden lab that might or might not exist?"

  

frisk gives a quick smile and heads inside looking for a information desk of some type

  

With a push, the large doors of the library open.

  

@'Asifa and @Frisk [Arken] are met by a tall, slim figure bearing blue skin. A Vedalken woman.

  

She peers down from her elevated desk through tiny glasses.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Ahem. Sir. No pets." She points to a sign by the door that says 'No pets inside'.

'Asifa

"Pet? Huh. @Frisk [Arken] in truth I never considered that thing as any more a pet than the armor I where. Just a tool."

  

Frisk

“Ya it's not so much a pet...more like an ally and I know that sounds like "my pets not a pet but a best friend kinda deal but he’s literally made for war and delivery, also he mechanical not a dog he just acts like a dog.”

  
  

Vedalken Librarian

"Uh huh."

  

'Asifa makes a Persuasion check!

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Hmmm. One. Spot. Anywhere. I'll have you both fined and elected for public service duties."

  

She casts a hostile look to Pon. "Filthy creature. All beings need maintenance of solids and fluids, organic or not."

  

"Um, thank you ma'am." 'Asifa pulls out the book. "You can read this, right? We are looking for someone who can help us understand it."

  

She stops reading her books and resets her glasses to take a closer look

  

Vedalken Librarian

"...This is in Vedalken, my native language. Let's see here... A journal it seems."

  

She flips through the pages. At first her expression is that of boredom. A few pages further, her eyes widen.

  

"Hmmm, may I?"

  

She tugs on the book, gesturing if she may hold it.

  

'Asifa gives her a look as if to say 'just remember it's mine' and hands it over.

  

Frisk

....pretty intense moment here...i'll stay quiet for this...

  

A quick reset of her glasses. Her gaze travels quickly through the pages. She flips past the pages as if barely reading them at all.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Physomage Artur..."

  

1 minute passes. She shuts the book and passes it gently to @'Asifa.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Your book has been mostly annotated into Common. A few phrases were off here and there, but for the purposes of research, it's enough."

  

"What exactly did you need additional research on?"

  

Frisk

So, if seen this guy work for my self and it's impressive, to say the least, I believe there has to be more information on him here...so know where I can find it?

  

Vedalken Librarian

"4th Level, Nonfiction Section. Physics Arcana. Physomage Artur was an impressive man before... well, the disappearances."

  

She turns to 'Asifa.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"While it is none of my business, that book is of high value to the Ismeri Library. That journal is obviously from the source himself. I highly suggest donating such an article of valuable information immediately. In turn, the Library will make note of the donor, as well as a respectable sum of gold for your contribution to the Library."

  

Frisk

....if we do that is it possible to get a word for word translation for are selfs?

  
  

Vedalken Librarian

"Ummm, no that won't be necessary. The book, as I said before, is satisfactorily translated for the purposes of research. Common Vedalken phrases such as "Ifkinari Etanzo Candeminar" in the book do not translate well into common. The closest translation to that would be "Bird of Blue sun sings dark fabric shells."

  

Frisk

“I mean is it possible to get a scribe to copy the book down for us so we can let you keep the original, and we take the copy.”

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Yes, I suppose so, at a small subtraction of the sum of gold."

  

Frisk

Alright, if asifa okay with that am I too

  
  

'Asifa nods. "As long as we come away with the information in that book, yes, that's ok with me. How long will it take to scribe?"

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Only a moment."

  

'Asifa

"Let's do it then."

  

The Librarian puts a finger against her lips and quietly exhales a long ssssshh.

  

Bluish-white smoke slowly flows out from her mouth. It materializes and takes the form of a ghost like bird, no bigger than a parakeet.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Tell Auselis to send over 4995 gold. Prepare it in 10 reduction bags."

.

"Cheeep Cheep!" The ghost bird chirps loudly. In a flash, the bird disappears. Seconds later, it reappears. It chirps once before disappearing in a puff of white smoke.

.

She takes Artur's journal in hand while swiftly pulling out another book from an underneath drawer desk. Placing the books together, She quietly whispers to herself. The books glow a faint blue.

  

The sound of paper ripping apart. The smell of old newsprint. Finishing her ritual, she hands the blank book to Frisk.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Here you are. Take a gander. I've included not only the original transcription but the Common translation in clear print."

  

The book is noticeably thicker and doesn't smell of crusty seafoam. The cover isn't leather bound. Pristine pages are thinner to hold more information. It feels lighter.

.

As soon as the ritual was finished, a floating metal tray holding 10 black canvas bags flies from an overhead balcony and lands on the Librarian's desk.

  

Vedalken Librarian

"4995 gold. Enough to buy an extravagant set of armor, should you choose to purchase one. I've subtracted 5 gold due to material pricing.

  

I apologize for the cost of stationery, but Ismeri only uses high quality blank books for transcription of information. You'll notice the magic seal of the library on the back cover, as proof that the original is with us. The Journal of Artur will be available for research after the proper processes to ensure its longevity."

  

Frisk

frisk will hand the book to asifa and push the bags of gold in to his bag of holding

"Not sure how where going to handle the gold situation....but ill be honest if you want to go half and half and not just talk about this to the others...will am willing to do the same unless you feel like you need to share your new found wealth?"

  

'Asifa

Asifa's mouth turns in a smirk. "Oh, did you want some of this?"

"How about this. We hold this gold in common, separate from our other wealth. We use it when the two of us agree that we have an expense needed to move us forward toward our goals of fixing that gate, the construct, and the castle, prioritized in that order."

  

Frisk

"Hummmm....deal I like your moxi your my favorite out of the group now, but sense I have a bag of holding ill stuff that in there for now."

  

Frisk shives the rest of the bags in to the bag of holding then turns to the librarian 

"Real quick Plains walkers know of any?"

  

Vedalken Librarian

"You'll find our Agricultural section on Level 6. We have books on Bovines, Equestrianism and the care of goats and sheep. All manner of Plains walkers. Unfortunately I am not friends any such creatures of the farm.If that is what you are asking.``

  

Frisk

It's not but that answers my question, either way, thank you for all your help where going to head what was it? 4th level nonfic physics arcana?, right?

  

Vedalken Librarian

"Correct."

  

Frisk

"Thank you again will be on are way." Frisk will start up to the 4th floor if there a area clear if any people I want to stop and pull asifa aside

  

Seems the mode of transportation in the Ismeri Library is floating metal boxes that move in 3 dimensions. Although there are numerous staircases, they are blocked by a number of scholars surrounded by mountains of books.

.

A young man donning the uniform of the Librarian usher Asifa and Frisk into a metal box. Gently it floats up.

  

The metal box opens and the two step out. The coast is clear along the aisle of the Nonfiction- Physics Arcana Section.

  

Frisk

"Real quick before anyone else hears us..." They have no idea what a Plains walker is? You know what that means right?, where on some groundbreaking stuff here....so it's best if we don't get in to, well to much detail on what we're looking for....i have a feeling that, if we where to find that....thing...they wouldn't have any second thoughts on tearing it from are hands, get what I mean?

  

'Asifa

"Well, I'm not sure if you are right on that or not. But I'm happy to let you study your books and see if you can find your answers. Still, there must be someone who knows something about planeswalkers and if you don't find what we need in the books, we'll have to try another approach."

  

Frisk

From what we where told they don't have a lot of personal journals from him....but here my idea in the book he talks about laylines right? If I where to build to lab to study that, will I would do it where there lines cross the most, on top of that he mentions a family castle am hoping we can find a location for that in books about himself, hopefully, it will lead us in the right direction.....90% of what am saying is me just guessing on my accounts but am happy to know you're supportive of my curiosity.

  
  

A number of adolescent students pass @'Asifa and @Frisk [Arken]. They make no sign of hiding their intrigue as they walk past.

  

Student One

"...dude, did you check her out? That chick was fine. Think she's in the Arts Department?"

  

Student Two

"You are such a creep, Craig. You can't go 10 minutes without looking at some lady's ass."

  

Student Three

"I've never seen someone with gray skin and, like, lightning-y freckles. freckles? freckles. A Simic hybrid maybe?"

  

Student One

"Hey, hey, hey. I am a hot blooded Minotaur. Just look at me. I'm a studmuffin. A fuckin' sex automaton. She's lucky I didn't give her my room number."

  

Student Two

"See this? this 'big dick energy' that you're constantly spinning around? This is why we can't get dates."

  

Student One

"Not my problem, you're as tasty as pork ice cream. If you'd just fix that stupid fuckin' cut of yours, maybe Alexa from Bio'd give you a chance to tap that, but idk, bro. Hey, what do you ... test ..."

.

The students are out of earshot.

  

Frisk

"....that was hmmm wow...big dick energy huh? You interested @'Asifa [Ithinkiam] ?" 

Frisk laughs as he starts walking towards the books there looking for

  

'Asifa

'Asifa is determined to ignore the boys' sexualizing behavior. They're just kids after all. No need to put them in their place or teach them a lesson. But she just can't help herself. Just before they walk out of range she subtly gestures with her hand and sends a gust of wind their way, with the aim of pushing them into each other.

  

The lightning streaks across 'Asifa's grey skin flash briefly. A gust of violent wind forces in through the windows. It's strong enough to push two of the students into the library shelves, knocking out some books onto the other side. Loose sheets of paper fly out everywhere as students look up to the excitement.

  

Student One

"WHoa-"

  

Student Three

"What in the-"

  

Student Two

"Huaou what's happening omg"

  

Two of the students lie on top of one another in a pile of books. A robotic drone flies down and occasionally releases a small flash of light. Like lightning. It speaks in a robotic fashion, like the announcer in the airship station.

  

Drone

"YOU ARE BOTHERING THE OTHER STUDENTS OF ISMERI LIBRARY VIA HORSEPLAY. CEASE AND DESIST. MEET AT THE FRONT DESK OR HAVE YOUR LIBRARY PRIVILEGES PERMANENTLY REVOKED. I REPEAT, MEET AT ..."

  

Student One

"No, no we weren't doing nothing, this was- see there was this freak wind that just..."

  

Frisk

frisk quickly pulls Asifa away from the situation and to the books there looking for

  
  

The two begin to pore over the books, the Physics section looking for any and all bits of information that could help them in their endeavor.

  

Portals

There is an exception in the book Arcanum Mass Transfer vII about the theoretical possibility of transferring matter through some kind of mana-charged threshold. But the amount of mana required would drain the life force of half of the Paruns (guild founders), both living and deceased.

Planeswalkers

Reading through textbooks in notable persons throughout history, there doesn't seem to be any note of Planeswalkers.

  

Flying Castles

Flying structures are not uncommon in the Tenth District, they are simply unimaginably expensive. The most well known structure that floats to this day is the Millennial Platform that hovers over the city. Of the many Orzhov and Vedalken families that owned flying structures, there is a note of the Physio-Mage Artur Votrolskar, who had flown his family's castle North.  The paragraph ends there.

  

Constructs

There are numerous constructs in use all throughout the Tenth District such as the floating metal trays that hover in the Ismeri Library. Often these constructs are crafted by the Izzet League. You can find them for sale all throughout the city in various shapes and sizes.

  

Frisk

Okay so not much on are guys...but looks like I can get some info on the construction of shell and the flying castle....i know you're not too focused on that but am going to need another lead about where we could find that lab there has to be one in this city...

.

.

.

  

Hours pass. The two continue to look through books despite their interest running thin.

  

Amazingly, an obscure paragraph in the textbook "Great Application: The Vedalken Dialogue" details Artur and a lab that he frequented.

  

...Artur was close to Endar, having spent their breaks playing 4 simultaneous games of Human chess while eating the seafood both were fond of.

  

When Artur suddenly left, Endar took over the Physio-Mage's laboratory. Having renamed it 'Endar's Experiments'. To this day, the laboratory stands.

  
  

'Asifa and Frisk peek out the windows. Nightfall has arrived.

  

Frisk “Looks like we found what we were looking for. We need to go to Endar’s experiments.”

  

After the research, the two feel sticky and uncomfortable. When was the last time they had lounged in the sun with a cup of tea or coffee? Or even sat down in comfort? The thought of a shower and a warm bed occupy their thoughts.

  

Frisk says ”You know what for your hard work and support, I'll treat you to a nice hot meal, a shower and some tea. How about it?”

  

'Asifa smirks. "I will take you up on that. We should see how the others have fared. Then I hope to spend a night sleeping in my own bed, er, cot. But yes, we will return to Endar's Experiments. And this time, we will demand an audience."

  
Frisk smiles. “Let's make sure they’re nice plush beds."

End of 'Researchers Vignette.'

  

# Chapter 14D Kail

1. ### 7:25 PM_]_DM_:_ 
    
    @Kail emerges from the restroom, relieved. A peek through the window reveals Vesra by herself. Kail takes the closest exit out, leaving the tiefling by herself. His friend Rizzix could have been affected by the riots. A visit wouldn't hurt. Or he could go to Deadbridge Chasm in Precinct Six. See about a job offer there. (edited)

    Through the shadows, Kail stalks. The Rizzix's apartment isn't too far from the Red Wastes Gatehouse.
    
10. ### _[_10:57 AM_]_DM_:_ 
    
    . . . The town is silent. The occasional guard from the Red, Blue or Green, but the streets aren't as populated as they once were. Finally, Kail arrives. He stands in front of Rizzix's apartment. A glance down the hallway, left and right. No one in sight.

# Chapter 14E Vesra



# Chapter 15: We retire.

The group talk for a moment, and Kail lets slip the group's newfound money. The others home in on this.

The split the gold evenly.  With enough wealth to live comfortably, They split ways. They agree to meet up on a later date.

But the date never comes. A few days pass. A week. months.

Either with purpose or having simply moved on, only a few core members linger together, not forgetting the damage that Ansem had caused.

# Chapter 16:  Pond's Cousin, the shopkeeper.

A tussle in the caves, and a darkmantle.

It is too late. The cousin is dead.

# Chapter 17: Home

The group meets up with Pond's Cousin, wrapped up on a wagon.

They eat hearty meals, then split off, back to their homes. Each of them reflecting on the events that have transpired recently.

With no one around, Pond looks at his cousin's body. He is sullen. How will he explain this to Auntie?

He carts him to a local graveyard.

Just another night in the Tenth.


# Chapter 18: To a Brave New World

A few of the members reconvene. It seems there has been a new development. A portal has opened in the tenth. Much like the portal to 'Asifa's people.

Bogs, Pond, Groto, Garreth and a good friend, leave to find new fortune through it.

Also Bogs Hothands becomes good friends with Groto and they run around as roomies. It's a good time.

# Chapter 19: It's cold.

The party explore the area for a little bit. Seems some people are marching west, where fortune can be found in this new world.

# Chapter 20: Let us Split Ways

A mysterious force waves past the group. They feel... adrift. As if the gods watching over them have lost their will, and thus their guidance. As though the pantheon's storyteller has grown weary of his long-winded tale, despite his love for his audience.

The party is unsure how to continue this adventure.
All this time, and Ansem has simply travelled elsewhere? How long will they follow just past him? With each of their party members long gone, is it even worth honoring them anymore? Were they so close to warrant the invested time?

The group collectively decide to take a break from this quest of revenge. They agree to reconvene at a later date. But much like the core group from before, later may never come. It's a promise in the snow that may never see spring.

Still, it's important to rest.

But for how long?

# DM's Notes
From Greiye, the DM
19 August 2024

Thank you guys so much for the time you gave for the campaign. Hard to believe it was about 5 years ago.

And yes, I know that I claimed the hiatus in April, mid 2020, and it's just about past the middle of 2024.

Each of you really made me think about DnD and the power that creatives can harness when making a fun game together. I was **challenged** to give you guys a good game. It's only years later that I realized how good of a party I had.

I apologize for how things ended. (How often do DnD campaigns end successfully anyway?)

I won't ask for any more of your time. But I do want all of you to know  that this campaign has been an unending fuel for my love of Storytelling/ TTRPG. It's made me realize how much I enjoy the open creativity of acting and authoring.

I can't say that I enjoy TTRPG's in general, but I enjoy the method of being creative around a hard system that DnD 5e provided.
