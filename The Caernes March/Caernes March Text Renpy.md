 "For reasons outside of your control, you and a handful of other Initiates have joined this mercenary guild: "

  

    "The Caerne."

    "The group's name is taken from an old word from a bygone era, meaning 'rock'."

    "The mercenary group was meant to be a solid entity for others to rely on."

    "The last option for desperate nobles and warmongers alike."

    "The starting line, the last line of defense."

    "Anything, for anyone with the gold coins to pay."

  

    "It has been about 2 weeks since you've joined."

    "Members of The Caerne are still curious about you."

    "They watch you. Talk about you while they chow down."

  

    "Some of them drop by your tent to ask for your services, or tell you to help around camp."

  

    "They're nice people."

    "It makes you wonder what things they've had to do in this field of work."
