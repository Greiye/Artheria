Iron-Tail is a black-furred Nezumi—known as ratfolk to outsiders—who takes great pride in her appearance, keeping her fur meticulously groomed despite wearing plain clothing. Her years of toiling in the swampy fields, planting lotus seeds for sustenance, have given her a defined, muscular physique. While she's not overly muscular, her strength is evident. Iron-Tail carries herself with a natural confidence, and even when she's uncertain, others look to her for guidance. She meets this expectation with a brave face.

For most of her life, Iron-Tail was content scavenging the swamps for valuables and cultivating the land for food. It was hard, honest work, and she found satisfaction in it. Lacking the intellect to pursue higher education and raised by her heretical but loving parents to be an iconoclast, Iron-Tail was never pious enough to ascend the Nezumi hierarchy. Instead, she accepted her role as a farmer, living a simple, happy life.

That changed one fateful day when a **monstrous beast with acidic saliva** invaded her swamp, rampaging through the village she calls home. Driven by fear and a sense of duty, Iron-Tail sprang into action, armed with nothing but a shovel. She fought the creature fiercely, dodging its acidic attacks and landing blow after blow. Her bravery and quick thinking saved the village. In recognition of her heroism, she was knighted during the ensuing celebration.

Iron-Tail felt the weight of her new responsibilities and the expectations of others pressing upon her. Yet, this burden felt strangely comfortable, for she believed that in a world without gods, it was heroes who were needed most.

#### Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

#### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

#### Divine Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

History
#### 1 Iron Tail and a coinpurse

As Iron-Tail is doing her duties around camp, she overhears the boss, Yarl, talking to a fellow bandmember. They're talking about the recent crimes in camp.

Two of my men. **dead** . On the same day. Too close a coincidence.

Rupert was as trustworthy as he is fast, but he didn't deserve his fate. Burned to a crisp because he wanted a bit more to eat. Maybe if he was more open to sharing he would've cooked in the open kitchen, and he wouldn't be 6 feet under by that tree.

And Karaku... 
He was a good man. His wife will miss him.

Ex-Wife.

He was indispensable. He had a way with the ladies in all the taverns and festivals we visited.

Probably why his wife left him.

Wait, what? But Karaku kept talking about her as if his wife was a goddess. In great detail, at that. Golden hair, unworldly grace. He spoke of her so much, I found myself praying at her feet. In a sense, of course.

Prayed with her image in mind as well. Prayed almost every night. My praying hand aches just thinking about her.

He will be missed.

Oh, and I got the thing that you wanted. Earth Shaper Scrolls.

He passes the other mercenary a stack of scrolls. They're all wrapped up individually in leather.

Now I have to handle our gimp cavalier. An example is to be made.

Jarl gets up quickly and heads off. So too, does the other campmember.

Iron-Tail sees a glimmer. Where the two were just sitting is left a coinpurse.
It's spilled open, revealing gold coins, gems, sticks of herbs, and a few handmade trickets.

Upon closer inspection: *A human finger, preserved in a yellow substance in a small bottle sits in the coinpurse.*

What do you do?

Iron-Tail stops with what she was doing earlier, looking at the pile of treasures with some curiosity. The gold and gems made sense, and the herbs and sticks she could wave away as some sort of casting focus. But the finger was just macabre and distasteful. Fortunately, her reputation as a swamp country bumpkin gave her just enough clout to act in a certain matter. She grabs the pouch, but makes sure to dangle the finger in front of her as she tries to reunite the finger with their owner

Sir! Sir! You forgot your finger!

You follow after the other mercenary. It's not a sir.

You've seen her around camp, but haven't had a chance to say anything to her until now. 

She turns to see you, a warm expression on her face. Maybe due to not being a lot of women in the camp?

When she sees the finger dangling in front of you, her expression sours.

OH, uhh... ...th-that's...

She takes it quickly. 

Thanks.
She leaves in a rush. She doesn't bother to ask about the rest of the coinpurse.

Glad I could help out.
Iron-Tail turns around as the Merc scuttles off with her weird trinket. She's from the swamp, and is no stranger to macabre trinkets, even if they are a bit distasteful. Glowing with pride, she honestly forgets that she's holding into the pouch, and will probably keep forgetting until late at night when she checks over all of her things.

You're a bit confused of what just transpired with the other merc.

As the days pass, you learn that her name is Kaelrith, or Kayla for short. She's one of the older members of the group and is close with the leader, Yarl. They have a unique bond, as Kayla speaks to Yarl like a childhood friend.

When you ask about the finger, all you get is confusion.
No one knows anything about it, and thinks it as something Kaelrith wouldn't dare touch.

Since then, there are nights where you feels eyes on you. You can see in the dark as a proud Nezumi can, so if there's anything watching you from afar, you're confident you can see it.

You wonder about the strength of an owl's night vision.


#### 2 Iron Tail and a New Friend
A few days have passed since Torgon's Uprising. Everyone's had to pull double shift to make up for the lack of manpower.

Yarl's been running around, managing the camp as per usual, as well as conducting interviews. He's visibly tired.

He approaches Iron-Tail with a form on a clipboard and a quill of ink.

@Iron-Tail#283774 Iron Tail. Glad I caught you.

You, Derby and Onager have been pulling your weight around here, and then some. It's been a blessing.

As per when I created this band, I wanted everyone to chip in. This means chipping in recruitment thoughts as well.

@Iron-Tail#283774 His eyes are sunken as he hands the clipboard to you. He's tired.

The form is a list of potential recruits.

You read through it.

1. Ravenna "Shade" Valek
2. Brom "Hammer" Stonefist
3. Mira "Silver Tongue" Voss
4. Kael "Whisper" Thorn
5. Lyra "Spark" Emberwind Role: Demolition Expert and Pyromancer


Torgon planned to take over, yes, but he was also a natural born businessmen. He got us discounts on wares from merchants who wouldn't tell me the time of day. Maybe we need someone like him again.

Or maybe a sniper arbalist type. Derby's told me a story of how one pinned him down for a few days. That's a useful addition.

You tinker all day. Maybe we can hire someone with mechanical know how?

Up to you.

You sense that Yarl is tired, and will probably approve of who you decided to hire on.

Oh, there's more recruits on the following pages. You've got about 20 recruits in total, about. 4 pages.

If you need someone to help smooth things over with clients, I could always lend a hand. My swampy charms lend a bit of weight to negotiations.

Iron flips through the entire booklet of recruits, just to be through. Wouldn't want to miss someone just because they were all the way in the back!

A loose page flies out of the clipboard.

It's another list of people to hire. But this list has people with no combat capabilities.

21. Gilda "Brightforge" Ironhand - Role: Arcane Blacksmith and Metalworker
22. Tobin "Gearsmith" Carver - Role: Mechanical Systems Engineer
23. Liora "Starling" Windwalker - Role: Advanced Drone Specialist
24. Finnian "Woodsman" Greaves - Role: Eco-Builder and Renewable Resource Engineer
25. Rowan "Spark" Alder - Role: Arcane Energy Specialist and Power Engineer

It's sparse on detail.

If you want my judgement... Miss Jenna, Oren, and Kael seem like decent candidates. If you're asking me to pick only one, then Jenna fills two roles that we could sorely use. Of the miscellaneous recruits, I wouldn't mind Gilda to hone our weapons.

Jenna the Firedancer, with 2 votes.
Oren the Shadowblade.
Kael the Sniper/Tracker.

and Gilda, the Arcane Metalworker.

I see, I see.

He sighs. Not out of anything bad, He's simply tired. He's got uneven stubble and red eyes.

I'll see if I can get a hold of them.

Have you been getting enough sleep lately Yarl? If you need us to shoulder the burden, we're more than happy to help out.

He looks at you. Well, more through you.

What did you have in mind?

Well, for starters, I could probably handle gathering and interviewing the potential candidates. Or at the very least help you split them up. Obviously, you should probably talk to them as you're the leader of this merry band of mercs. You have the final say of who gets in. But more than anything, I want you to know that we're a team, and you can rely on us.

He's listening to you intently, but you can tell that the moment he so much as grazes a soft fabric, he'll pass out on the dirt.

... I appreciate that. I do.

*yawn* but the interviews have been conducted. This was my approval list.

Since the little Torgon takeover incident, I've been traveling every inch of this city to find good replacements. Ones that won't organize a hostile takeover.

They all seemed receptive to tag along. Anything to get out of this city, I suppose. So much talent.

You liked Jenna on paper, right? She sounds like a good combat asset?

I found her in the carnival last night. She was throwing fire daggers clear across the tent. Hit every mark AND made delicious barbeque.

Some people just aren't blessed to realize their true potential by themselves. They need a little push from someone who cares. Maybe we all do.

He folds the paper on the clipboard and begins to walk away.

I appreciate what you said. Okay, I'll depend on you just a little bit. Let me get some sleep and think about that.


Have a good night Yarl. Get some sleep.

He walks backwards to face you and flashes a weak smile.

...
The next day Yarl has you taking the big caravan wagon with Onager to collect wares for the camp. Foods, Materials, Kerosene, etc. He asks that you do what you can to renegotiate their deals.

It was like a good guard/ bad guard routine. The whole wagon tips towards Onager's side as it pulls to the merchant's business.

Onager did say he wasn't feeling well, and was quite irritable. He had a murderer's expression on the whole day. He was 6'8" mess of easily irritable half-orc.

It was either deal with him, or deal with you. *They chose to deal with you.*

What you call ' your swampy charm' is a hit with the merchants. You even manage to secure a few discounts here and there.

With since you're both rather strong, you didn't need additional hands, which gave you both more storage space in the wagon.

Yarl looks better rested when you two return from a day of bargaining and moving wares.

Oh, Iron-Tail, look who joined us while you were gone.

You see a young woman with pale skin, bright red hair, and foreign clothes from a far land. She's sheepishly looking around.

Jenna, this is Iron-Tail. She's the one who recommended you.

She's from the swamps. She's got some engineering experience from what I gather, and enjoys tinkering around with tech.

H-Hi.

Iron Tail
"Well, hey there! Welcome to the band. As Yarl said, I'm, Iron-Tail. I'm the one who vouched for you, although to be fair, Yarl also vouched for you to come on. A pleasure to meet face to face with you."

Iron-Tail holds her arms out, expecting a hug.

Jenna
"...Are you sure?"

She doesn't wait. She walks into you and embraces you tightly as though she hasn't hugged anyone in a long while.

You hear sizzling.

When she pulls away, there's a light smoke and smell of scorch around you. Your clothes have been singed and imprinted by her hands and clothes.

Ooof. Yeah. She's.. *Emberborn*, was it? Lavakin? It's all the same meaning really, from different languages. I remember it as Fire Genasi. A being of fire.

She runs hot. Not enough to start fires when she's asleep, but if you give her a glass of water it'll start to boil in an hour.

I keep a bolt of fabric from back home. It's fireproof. I'm a *great* seamstress.

Ah. I should have guessed from the emphasis on fire. Well, no harm no foul right? Besides, it looks like you really could have used a hug anyway.


*'A Warm Personality'* her billboards would say.

Jenna looks you up and down. She smiles at you.

We'll be good friends. I know it.

I get that vibe from you too. Now, how about we celebrate our new arrival with a little party? Let's use some of the scrimpings from our deals to have a night on the town!



Yeah. Let's do it. My time at the carnival's really limited my time outside the carnival.

A night out huh... Let's see where this goes. I'll get Kaelrith.

The news of an outing tonight is spread across the camp. It just so happens that the city they're currently in, has all the makings of a good night out.

There's so many taverns huddled on the same street that one could 'crawl' from one to another. 
The new addition, Jenna, had just given up her contact that the carnival, but can talk to some people to let them through without charge.
And it seems a popular music bard is playing at a local tavern: It will be attended by the most raunchiest of nobles and peasants alike.
Tonight is the perfect night, and in close proximity to visit it all in one go.

#### 3 Iron Tail and the Generator

Yarl bumps into Iron-Tail and Jenna playfully.

Ladies. We're running into a problem.

I think...

...I think *i'm sobering up.*

Jenna gasps playfully

Oh, *whatever shall we dOooOo*

Our Orcish friend and Medic Extraordinaire are indisposed.

Soon, we will all be sober. And the journey of the night will come to a dull end.

Jenna turns her head, puts a hand to her temple, like in those stage plays.

Oh, mercy! We must fix this problem posthaste! Irontail, with me, darling. I know of a man who keeps a bar, with the proper vapours and spirits for our conundrum!

She grabs Irontail and goes.

As the ladies are fetching more ale for the party, Iron Tail gets a good look at the giant machine that's powering the festival lights. The steam generator.

This close, the machine's rather loud as it chugs on. There's a large puddle of water all around it, radiating all around the machine about 5 feet out.

A closer look. It's the filter. You can see it right from where you're standing, but it's not directly noticeable unless you're used to it. It's dirty and moldy. The water generators back home in the swamps were always kept clean.

The engineer's right there. A human man with a yellow construction helmet on and a big belly.

You explain to him that 'using dirty water filter needs replacement. The gunk inside the generator makes it work harder and wear out faster. The pipes can get clogged, and the machine might even crack or burst. The machine needs clean water to keep running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.'

...

He grabs a wrench from a toolbox on a crate nearby.

And immediately swings at you, right for the side your head. You pull your head out just in time as the wrench clangs against the steam generator pipes.

...You beastfolk are something else.

Truly truly, something else.

...I will *not* be talked down to by a ***overgrown. PEST***.

Do you hear me!?

Just because your kind can *slur* the Common language, don't mean diddly squat to me.

Disgusting swamp rat.  I can smell the sewer off you and yours.

He turns to Jenna.

***...we got a problem, torchlight?***

She takes a few steps back, unsure of what to do.

Yeah.

That's what I thought.

He turns to his console and disregards you both.

(under his breathe)
{Ain't *no one* gonna tell me how to keep the carnival lights on. That generator's been fine for year's; it'll be fine for another 10.

I've stomped rats bigger than you dead. Think I'll treat you any different because you squeak my language? try again.}



What does Iron Tail do?

Iron Tail Thoughts
"It would be so easy to just walk away from all of this and have this be merely an unpleasant bookend to an otherwise fantastic evening out. It's not like she worked for the carnival, and if the carnival suffered because of an incompetent, racist technician, there would be no skin off her back. But she was just prideful enough, and inebriated enough to want to intervene anyway. But first, she was going to humble this bigot. Iron-Tail pretends to walk away from the technician, but just as they exit from view, she swivels around and casts command, uttering a single word."

"Piss."

The man is going about his business, looking busy. He's flicking switches back and forth, turning knobs that don't need to be turned.

A warm sensation in his groin, trailing down.

He looks down, horrified. He's gone and pissed himself.

A halfling passes the girls and walks up to the rude man. Iron Tail reads the back of his construction vest. '**Superintendent**'.

"Henry, I need you to take a look at the maintenance logs.

You've been writing that you do rust checks every 4 hours on the dot, but just the other day I saw a bit of rust *here and there*.

I need you so show me how you conduct your ch-"

He stops when he sees the large urine stain on his pants. It's directly eye level to the halfling.

"... *Okayyyy*. I see there's a few things we need to talk about."

I'm gonna go find someone to relieve you. Then we're gonna talk about inappropriate appearance around minors.

He starts walking away, shaking his head.

"{hehehe... just can't find good help...}"

Jessa pulls Iron-Tail away from all this and towards their intended stop.

Oh my gods, *I cannot believe that just happened*. I pass that guy all the time at work, there was just something so *creepy* about him, couldn't say why. Then he goes and pisses himself right after trying to fight you? Think he got too excited? Omigods, like, *gross*!

Jenna links arms with Iron-Tail and laugh about the whole exchange.

The jacket was a good idea. This time around, it doesn't singe your arm, but rather feels nice and toasty.

The girls continue on their way.

Occasionally, they are stopped by a few men who attempt to flirt with them, asking them to play carnival games with them. 

Task at hand, they politely refuse.

They procure drinks and continue back to the group.
