For reasons outside of your control, you and a handful of other Initiates have joined this mercenary guild: 

**The Caerne.**

The group's name is taken from an old word from a bygone era, meaning 'rock'*.
The mercenary group was meant to be a solid entity for others to rely on. The last option for desperate nobles and warmongers alike. The starting line, the last line of defense. Anything, for anyone with the gold coins to pay.

It has been about 2 weeks since you've joined. Members of The Caerne are still curious about you. 
They watch you. Talk about you while they chow down.

Some of them drop by your tent to ask for your services, or tell you to help around camp.

They're nice people. 
It makes you wonder what things they've had to do in this field of work.

#### 1 Derby and the Orphans

A group of children, orphans really, pop into camp. Some of the band enjoy playing games with them, teaching them how to fight.

One of them has a broken arm. He's called 'Pidgeon', because it looks like a wing, with the way that it bends when he walks.


That's not his only issue. He's covered in sores. These sore you've seen before. **High-Pox**. It'll infect you. Make you weak for days, if not weeks.


"Derby faces a difficult choice."

"He has the knowledge and the medicine to heal Pidgeon, but using them will come at the cost of his own health."

Derby watches Pidgeon from a distance, carefully studying the boy for several minutes. His eyes scan over the other children, looking for any signs of High-Pox among them.

As the children play, Derby keeps his distance, pretending to admire the trees and enjoy the scenery near the village. His gaze, however, keeps drifting back to the group of kids.

**None of the other children show signs of High-Pox yet.** But Derby knows it’s only a matter of time before the disease spreads to all of them. His medical expertise tells him the truth: the infection will inevitably make its rounds.

He remembers the upcoming mission the head of the band mentioned. If the children remain in camp, they could infect the entire group, rendering them unfit for combat. The thought of it makes his stomach churn.

With a resigned sigh, Derby heads back to his tent. He reaches for his medical suitcase but stops short, hesitating. His hand hovers over the handle as he thinks. He curses softly in Draconic, then turns away from the tent, determination setting in his features. He strides out to find one of the mercenaries.

Nearby, the band members and the children are having a good time, kicking a football around. Derby approaches one of the mercenaries, his voice low but urgent.

“You see that child with the broken arm? He’s carrying a disease—a plague that spreads easily. Warn the others. You need to get them out of here before the whole camp becomes unfit for combat.”

Derby doesn't wait for a response. He turns on his heel and heads back toward his tent, deliberately avoiding looking at the boy again. The image of Pidgeon's broken arm, flapping like a chicken wing, is already burned into his mind.

At first, the band members exchange skeptical glances. Who does Derby think he is, giving orders like he’s in charge? He’s not the head of the band. But then they remember the times he’s helped them with mouth sores, foot rashes, and other ailments. His white coat isn’t just for show.

Reluctantly, they take the children's ball and kick it as far away as possible, telling the kids to leave.

Some of the children look puzzled, unsure of what they’ve done wrong. Others roll their eyes, assuming it’s just another group of adults who’ve grown tired of them. They laugh together and start searching for another group of people to bother.

As Derby returns to his tent, the image of Pidgeon's arm, bending awkwardly like a bird's wing, haunts him.


#### 2. Derby and Blackmail

A few days have passed.

The band has just wrapped up their latest operation. That’s the rhythm here: do a job, go monster hunting, or fight a platoon. Then relax for a week or so while they recruit and account for the losses, keeping their numbers strong.

One of your fellow mercenaries approaches you.

"Darcy, was it? Darby? Or was it Derby, like the races? Doesn’t matter. Listen, I need to talk to you."

He gestures for you to follow him to a wooden bench table in the open kitchen. Derby follows, ignoring the comments about his name, curious about what this might be.

"Listen... I know who you are. You worked on a noble not too long ago, right? Easy money. It was about a year ago, yeah? A nose job? The poor man thought his nose was too big for a noble. And indeed it was. He caught one too many peasants staring at it. Must have been bigger than his eyes and mouth, yes? AhaHAHAHA.

Well... it’s gone sour. Stitches came off a bit too early. The noble got too excited for his birthday present. Now he’s hunting for you, mate. 300 gold pieces for _any_ information on you."

The mercenary pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in.

"You're the Lunatic Doctor. You did it for a noble house that was on its way out. You must have done everything right; you're as brilliant as you are a loon, even the nobles knew that. You just... didn't account for _**Human Error.**_

Now, that’s 300 reasons for me to walk away right now and tell him where you are. Give me a reason why I shouldn’t."

Derby’s thoughts swirl for a moment. "Well, indeed, the methods I applied were from some old scripts I found in a monk's temple... perhaps I shouldn't have scraped off all of his nose and used the skin from his forehead to form it up... Could've done a lot of things differently, I suppose.

Ah yes, the bribe you’re trying to take from me, forgive me. Even though I would have been capable of paying that amount in my previous line of work, that is not the case anymore. That’s the price I pay to work for passion, I suppose. But even if I could cover that amount, how do I know you won’t double-cross me and get double your pay’s worth?"

"That's simply a risk you'll have to take," the mercenary says, tapping his fingers on the wooden table in a gesture that clearly signals his demand for money.

Derby takes a moment, his mind racing. "Well, I believe there's more to discuss here. Give me a bit of time to gather your gold. But if you decide to rat me out anyway, remember—are you really willing to get rid of the only doctor keeping these people alive? No doctor means more people getting hurt, increasing your chances of taking a hit, and no one to patch you up if you do. However, if you send them in the wrong direction... well, that's a whole different story, isn’t it?"

The mercenary’s expression shifts. He hadn't considered that angle. You can see the gears turning in his mind.

After a moment, his eyes brighten with a new idea. He looks toward the horizon, watching the sunset.

"... We’ve got about an hour until sundown. 300 gold. No less. If I come back and you don’t have it, I leave, and you’ll _**hang**_ in two days’ time."

With that, he walks away, heading back to his tent. Derby watches him go, then heads to his own tent, casually packing his gear. As he reaches for his bedroll, he reveals an old cavalry rapier and places it beside his belongings. He steps outside, spotting a nearby horse—a fast one.

Behind his tent, he finds a stash of torch and lantern supplies. The lantern fuel, known as kerosene, is stored in several metal jugs, ready for the mercenary band’s night operations. Derby gathers his backpack, sword, and medical suitcase before walking over to the horse.

He cuts the tether and mounts the horse, riding slowly around the camp until he locates the portly mercenary’s tent. The man is already sound asleep.

Derby’s mind races with possibilities. He could douse the tent with lantern fuel and set it ablaze. No one really likes him, anyway. Alternatively, a more direct approach—finding a gun and leading him to a secluded area—flashes through Derby's mind.

Opening his suitcase, Derby retrieves a vial filled with a dark, oily substance and a small firework bomb, a remnant of his experiments with alchemy. He throws the vial at the tent, casting _Grease_, and then ignites it with the firework, using _Fire Bolt_. The moment the flames roar to life, he spurs the horse into a swift gallop away from the scene.

In an instant, the tent is engulfed in flames. No one sees Derby commit arson. No one witnesses the pyromania. The canvas catches fire quickly, turning the man's snores into screams of agony that pierce the night air. The cries last only a few minutes before fading into silence. Mercenaries rush to douse the flames, but it’s already too late. The scent of burning flesh—horrifyingly similar to roasting beef or pork—fills the camp. The other half of the smell is burning leather, thick and acrid. Derby tastes it in his throat, unsure whether he is disgusted by the realization that it’s a human being burning or by the fact that he finds the scent somewhat sweet, like honey barbecue.

Ashes cling to his clothes, a grim reminder of his actions. Throughout the night, the thoughts nag at him—perhaps a bullet would have been kinder. Strangely, he finds himself craving chicken wings.

He rides out of the camp, his alibi set: he was out searching for herbs and medicinal plants, should the band run out of medicine.

The next morning, the camp buzzes with the news of the fat bandmember’s death. Some joke that he must have set fire while cooking beef in his own tent. The group has a dark sense of humor—**vulgar**, even.

When Derby returns, the mercenaries approach him for help, complaining of bleeding gums and sunken eyes. He prescribes oranges for their scurvy. Time passes, and no one mentions the lost comrade. Clearly, the man had as much respect as he did well-fitting armor—next to none, judging by the chatter among the more crass members of the band.

Yet, a nagging feeling lingers in Derby’s mind. Could one or two fellow initiates have seen what happened? Perhaps. Hmmm.

#### 1 Onager and Value

You stand by your tent, watching as the Doctor dealt with the street kids. Smart man, that Derby. Quick on his feet. Derby, like the races. Mentally agile. He’s someone you’ll keep an eye on.

It’s your job to know things, after all. Being an investigator means gathering information, and not just any information—accurate information.

And it’s accurate that those kids were sick. Derby did right by sending them away. High-Pox would’ve spread like wildfire through the camp. Nasty stuff, that High-Pox. Here’s looking at you, kid.

It’s also accurate that he set that tent on fire. You saw it happen. Derby didn’t know you saw, but you did.

So did someone else across from you. The figure didn’t know you saw, and Derby didn’t know either of you were watching. The question is, did the other figure see you watching too?

A conundrum.

Two crimes in less than 48 hours.

Scene one of two. Two witnesses, one culprit. What’s the motive? It’s been a day since you saw it, but your mind keeps circling back—

Oi.

You snap back to reality. In front of you stands another half-orc, covered in scars from countless battles, etched into his forearms and shoulders. Around you, other mercenaries gather—humans, half-elves, halflings, even a tiefling or two.

"**LISTEN** when we’re talking to you, greenskin."

"Now, you know we vote on every initiate, yeah? The boss insists. We all get a say in who joins the family. If someone’s not up to snuff, we kick ‘em out."

"...What was I saying? Oh, right. So."

"Yeah, we spared one of the enemy’s cavalry. His hand was smashed up good by a club. Fell off his horse and landed in the mud, leg bent like a twig, barely hanging on."

"He wasn’t a threat. I told the boss we should just slit his throat, give him a merciful end. Otherwise, he’s hobbling around like a fool for the rest of his life. Soldier can’t soldier anymore. Do him a favor and end it."

"But _nooo_, we had to be the good guys. Brought him back here to get patched up."

"And get this, just this morning, the day after that whole tent fire business, on the **morning** we were going to let him go, we find him in Karaku’s tent. Gave Karaku a smile from ear to ear across his throat. On the day we were gonna set him free. Can you believe it? You can’t make this up."

"Now, my issue is:"

"...How’d he manage that?"

"Guy’s got a busted wing and a broken leg, yet he somehow got out of his bindings, found a knife—dull one at that—crawled through the mud **again**, and did in Karaku."

"That’s a good ten meters he crawled—30 feet, for you simpletons—to get to Karaku’s tent. Did he even know where he was going? Who knows."

"And nobody saw him? Not a soul? Too busy keeping each other warm all night, were we? I say there’s something foul afoot. FOUL play."

The half-orc’s gaze settles on you, Onager.

"...Your tent was next to Karaku’s, yeah? Mine was on the other side."

"It’s fine that you didn’t hear nothing. I didn’t either, and I was sober last night. My eyes and ears are sharp, same as my blade. Not that one—this one:"

He pulls out a small knife from a cord around his neck and slams it onto the wooden table.

"My issue is this:"

**"...Could’ve been you.**"

"Or me. Could’ve been both of us waking up with a blade to our throats. Karaku just drew the short straw."

A pause.

"...So."

He stands, puts one foot on his seat, rests an arm on his knee, and leans in, waiting for your response.

"Next time we find a poor sod after a battle, why _**shouldn’t**_ we make it quick? The boss says it’s bad for business—that the nobles won’t hire us if we start putting holes in the wounded whenever we feel like it. But I say it’s not such a big deal. I say it’s not that deep."

"I say we should all _ahem_ ‘vote to change the terms of engagement during a battle,’ as the boss would put it."

The whole band is gathered, around ten or fifteen of you, though the Captain is absent.

The half-orc is setting you up, putting you on the spot where everyone will remember what you say, adding a touch of drama to the proceedings.

What do you do?

---

You clear your throat and speak.

"The Captain’s orders were clear, and I’ll follow them. If there’s ever a time they’re not, or I take issue with them, I’ll bring it up with him directly. As for what happened with the prisoner, I’m more than willing to investigate how he managed it, track him down, and either finish what his fall started or drag him back here to face justice."

The half-orc scrutinizes your face for sincerity, then shifts his gaze to a glint in the distance that catches everyone’s attention.

You all turn to see the head of the camp approaching, a smile on his face, carrying a sack of supplies slung over his shoulder.

"Case by case, eh? Okay, okay. I see you, greenskin."

"Ladies and gents, we’ve got someone here who knows how to throw their weight around. I figured as much, judging by that old 'Udo getup he’s got on."

He retrieves his knife from the table, using it to lazily gesture at your uniform.

"Well, I’m off to my duties."

With that, the rest of the group begins to disperse from the open chow hall. You’re left wondering if their view of you has shifted, uncertain whether their opinions have changed or remained the same.

#### 1 Iron Tail and a coinpurse

As Iron-Tail is doing her duties around camp, she overhears the boss, Yarl, talking to a fellow bandmember. They're talking about the recent crimes in camp.

Two of my men. **dead** . On the same day. Too close a coincidence.

Rupert was as trustworthy as he is fast, but he didn't deserve his fate. Burned to a crisp because he wanted a bit more to eat. Maybe if he was more open to sharing he would've cooked in the open kitchen, and he wouldn't be 6 feet under by that tree.

And Karaku... 
He was a good man. His wife will miss him.

Ex-Wife.

He was indispensable. He had a way with the ladies in all the taverns and festivals we visited.

Probably why his wife left him.

Wait, what? But Karaku kept talking about her as if his wife was a goddess. In great detail, at that. Golden hair, unworldly grace. He spoke of her so much, I found myself praying at her feet. In a sense, of course.

Prayed with her image in mind as well. Prayed almost every night. My praying hand aches just thinking about her.

He will be missed.

Oh, and I got the thing that you wanted. Earth Shaper Scrolls.

He passes the other mercenary a stack of scrolls. They're all wrapped up individually in leather.

Now I have to handle our gimp cavalier. An example is to be made.

Jarl gets up quickly and heads off. So too, does the other campmember.

Iron-Tail sees a glimmer. Where the two were just sitting is left a coinpurse.
It's spilled open, revealing gold coins, gems, sticks of herbs, and a few handmade trickets.

Upon closer inspection: *A human finger, preserved in a yellow substance in a small bottle sits in the coinpurse.*

What do you do?

Iron-Tail stops with what she was doing earlier, looking at the pile of treasures with some curiosity. The gold and gems made sense, and the herbs and sticks she could wave away as some sort of casting focus. But the finger was just macabre and distasteful. Fortunately, her reputation as a swamp country bumpkin gave her just enough clout to act in a certain matter. She grabs the pouch, but makes sure to dangle the finger in front of her as she tries to reunite the finger with their owner

Sir! Sir! You forgot your finger!

You follow after the other mercenary. It's not a sir.

It's an Owlin woman. 
You've seen her around camp, but haven't had a chance to say anything to her until now. 

She turns to see you, a warm expression on her face. Maybe due to not being a lot of women in the camp?

When she sees the finger dangling in front of you, her expression sours.

OH, uhh... ...th-that's...

She takes it quickly. 

Thanks.
She leaves in a rush. She doesn't bother to ask about the rest of the coinpurse.

Glad I could help out.
Iron-Tail turns around as the Merc scuttles off with her weird trinket. She's from the swamp, and is no stranger to macabre trinkets, even if they are a bit distasteful. Glowing with pride, she honestly forgets that she's holding into the pouch, and will probably keep forgetting until late at night when she checks over all of her things.

You're a bit confused of what just transpired with the other merc.

As the days pass, you learn that her name is Kaelrith, or Kayla for short. She's one of the older members of the group and is close with the leader, Yarl. They have a unique bond, as Kayla speaks to Yarl like a childhood friend.

When you ask about the finger, all you get is confusion.
No one knows anything about it, and thinks it as something Kaelrith wouldn't dare touch.

Since then, there are nights where you feels eyes on you. You can see in the dark as a proud Nezumi can, so if there's anything watching you from afar, you're confident you can see it.

You wonder about the strength of an owl's night vision.

#### 3 Derby and the Noble


Derby has become quite integrated with the group. Whenever someone falls ill or injures themselves, they're quick to visit 'The Doc'. You've seen your fair share of infections and sprains.

They've even set up a clinic tent in your honor, right next to your own, adorned with your symbol.

The Caerne has journeyed through numerous cities and towns since the fire.

While out shopping and socializing in one city with Iron-Tail to your left and Onager to your right, you spot a young man in pristine, noble clothing staring intently at you.

He approaches, visibly excited.

“It’s... it’s you. Gods above.”

He hesitates, then continues, “Do-do you remember me? Maybe you don’t. That’s fine, you had so many patients. Look, maybe—”

He starts to unbutton his sleeve. At first, you see nothing but a normal arm, leaving your companions puzzled.

“I know, everyone has the same look when I tell this story. Look—”

As he tugs the skin of his arm slightly, a hair-thin scar, marked by tiny dermal staple scars, becomes visible, running from his pinky all the way up his arm to his shoulder blade.

“It runs all the way to my shoulder blade. The old Doc’s a genius. This is *his* handiwork.”

You remember him now. A good lad who, tired of field rations, prepared you a rabbit stew with local herbs and provided cover during arbalist attacks.

“I’m actually in a bit of a rush—I’m about to be knighted. Valor in the field and all that. It took a while for the arm to heal, but when it did, it healed perfectly. And it’s thanks to you.”

He continues, “Is there anything I can do for you? I’ve got coin now. Need a favor of any kind?”

The half-orc investigator and the Nezumi step aside, observing how you handle this offer.

Derby responds, “I’m always delighted to hear that a patient of mine is thriving after such an operation.”

He adds, “As for a favor... well, money is always needed, but anything of value to you would be enough.”

The young man’s expression softens slightly, as if slightly disappointed by your response.

He reaches into his pocket and produces a golden pocket watch, intricately designed with the image of a four-eyed lion. He places it in your hand.

“I am **Etan Pendragon**. This is my symbol—a four-eyed lion that represents the Pendragon Line. I will inform my family of what happened today. Those in any of the Red Kingdoms will recognize this and treat you with the utmost respect, or face dire consequences. You’ve earned this boon.”

He looks into your eyes with a burning intensity, his respect evident.

“It’s only right that I give this to you. In a way, you’ve given me more time than anyone else.”

Etan pulls away, saluting Onager with a fist to his chest and bowing deeply to Iron-Tail. With precise military training, he rotates 180 degrees and marches off, accompanied by six plainclothes individuals—his hidden guard.

**Derby has obtained a Golden Pocketwatch!**

The interaction felt a bit rushed and surprising. It’s only when you return to camp that you realize something. 

You fought for the *Azul Empire*, not the Red Kingdoms.

Derby examines the pocket watch with a fascinated gaze. What an intriguing young man—perhaps a prince or a duke? Surely, an important person.


#### 2 Onager and the Other Half-Orc

Your experience with mercenary groups has taught you much about their nature. Mercenaries are sellswords, soldiers for hire. As cities grow, they need more than their own guard can provide, leading to neighboring cities supplying these hired hands. It's a cycle of war and profit; where there's conflict, there's money. Mercenaries spend their earnings on revelry, embodying the chaotic nature of their trade.

Yet, Yarl's group stands out. Unlike many, Yarl prioritizes honorable contracts, taking on lower-paying jobs for scholars and enduring injuries for modest pay. There's something commendable about him.

**"I say we take him after he's done with one of his charity jobs."**

You wake in the night, the grayness of dawn illuminating your tent. Peering out, you spot the half-orc from before—the one with the dramatic scars. You listen in.

They’re plotting to turn Yarl in for a bounty when he's at his most vulnerable. The life of a mercenary means you'll be either revered or despised wherever you go. In the coming days, as the group travels, there’ll be a few places where Yarl has a price on his head.

You recall his recent missions—tedious work, like that contract for digging through old relics for a measly 30 gold, despite having passed up a 200 gold contract. The half-orc is rallying support to overthrow Yarl and focus on profits instead of these so-called charity jobs.

The camp is divided, with half the members listening to him. His plan involves turning this "dictatorship" into a "democracy," shifting focus to money and indulgence.

At midday, with three hours until sunset, you face a choice. Using your connections, you could have the local guards arrest those conspiring with the half-orc, perhaps even frame them with planted evidence. This route will likely lead to a full-blown fight, consuming the next three hours.

Alternatively, you remember why you joined the group. Not for the money, but there’s something about Yarl. Despite his less lucrative contracts, he knows how to secure the best jobs, and his charisma commands respect. Aligning with him could be beneficial.

**Cast out Yarl** or **Report half the camp?**

Onager emerges from his tent as the half-orc's rants continue. He addresses the gathered crowd with a steely gaze.

"Are we plotting a mutiny now? Have we so little loyalty that we would ambush a man we’ve all sworn to support? No one here is chained to the March. If you’re unhappy with the leadership, leave with your honor intact. Don’t tarnish your reputations and ruin your careers. Better jobs are out there, but who will hire a mercenary company that can’t even trust its own?"

His eyes lock on the scarred half-orc, knowing his stance might invite danger. Then he surveys the crowd, making it clear that he’s ready for a confrontation.

"Which of you will be the first to attack Yarl? And how many times has he saved you? How many of you will fall before you manage to take him down?"

Standing tall at 6'8", Onager crosses his massive arms and scans the crowd for signs of dissent, preparing for the worst.

The scarred half-orc stands on a wooden table, still eyeing Onager.

With a grim smile, Onager unfolds his arms and gives a decisive nod.

**"HE KNOWS TOO MUCH, LADS. GET 'IM."**

They charge at you with weapons drawn. In the chaos, swords slice through the air as you nimbly dodge and counter with precision strikes that could be lethal if you chose. Arrows and bolts whiz by, some of them dangerously close. You deftly roll and duck, evading the onslaught with an almost supernatural agility.

Despite your imposing size, you manage to tuck and roll with remarkable speed, quickly regaining your footing. Your impressive maneuvers draw curious glances from those around you.

The commotion stirs the camp, rousing those who had been sleeping. They join the brawl, adding to the chaos.

After about 30 minutes of intense fighting, the conspirators are either restrained, knocked out, or have fled. Out of the original 14 members of The Caerne, only 7 remain, battered but united.

The half-orc who instigated the mutiny is bound and has a broken arm, courtesy of Onager. He had attempted to use a knife, but Onager acted swiftly to prevent serious injury.

Onager turns to you with a grim expression. 

"I'd hang you myself now if I didn’t want to see you squirm as you explain yourself to Yarl."

"No need to wait."
As if on cue, Yarl approaches. Onager steps aside, giving Yarl a respectful nod.

"I've known about this traitor's plans for some time," Onager says, bowing slightly to Iron-Tail. "It's easy to spot a threat when they're brandishing their swords. This one has a sharp tongue—his true weapon—but lacks the wit to match."

Yarl accepts a coil of rope from Onager and begins preparing a noose, searching for a suitable tree.

"So, Investigator, what should we do with him? I can’t just let him go. He needs to be made an example of, something everyone will remember."

Yarl looks at you, waiting for your input.

...
Yarl watches you as you efficiently handle the noose. 

"We can hang him, or I can cut him loose and beat him to death. He called for both our executions; he deserves no less."

He glances around, taking note of Kayla, Derby, and you, as if weighing options. 

"...Make it quick. Painless. I’m not a monster."

After swiftly tending to wounds, the camp sets up a hanging podium with crates and barrels. Out of the seven uprisers, only three remain: the half-orc and two others. Those who wish to witness the execution can, though most choose not to.

The noose is prepared with a tall tree as the backdrop. The crates are stacked high enough so that the half-orc only needs to step off to end his life. 

As the noose tightens around his neck, the scarred half-orc chuckles nervously. 

"Heh, heh, heh... I guess I got a real answer from you after all, eh? About a quick death?"

He smirks. "Can’t fault you. I would’ve come back with an even bigger group."

"What’s your name, greenskin? At least give me your full Orcish name. You owe me that much."


"Onager Caerne."
Onager steps up behind him, grabbing his shoulder and a handful of hair. With a swift, violent motion, he snaps the half-orc’s neck. The body dangles from the tree, the neck extending as his toes barely graze the grass.

The two remaining conspirators fall to their knees, praying desperately. They recognize the futility of their situation.

Yarl looks on with a face of distaste. He approaches the two survivors, cutting their bonds.

"I watched Torgon as I did Big Rupert. I know he was the mastermind. You two were just misled. Probably thought 'strength in numbers,' right? 

...If I see either of you again—anywhere—I break you. Then and there.

Best you become sailors if you want to guarantee your safety."

The two flee, one leaving a trail of urine in his wake.

Yarl senses Onager's presence behind him. 

"...It was the right decision, friend. Whatever god they prayed to found mercy in metoday."

He turns to you.

"Some days I think I’m too merciful. It’s never easy. But nothing worth having comes easy, right?"

You agree silently. 

Yarl continues, "I’m sorry we couldn’t reach more of them. I knew what would happen with the half-orc, but I hoped to sway a few others."

Yarl looks at the hanging body and then to you, a sense of resolve in his eyes.

"We’re mercenaries.
For every good recruit, there’s eleven bad ones to complete the dozen. These lot needed only a silver piece and a tankard to be swayed."

"You did well—better than good."

The body remains hanging until sunset. Yarl and Kaelrith eventually take it to the forest.

**Onager has earned Yarl, The Caerne Leader's Trust!**


Onager gives a rueful smile.

"Surviving until others joined in was crucial. We lost three and half the camp. Time to assess and plan our next move."

He chuckles at your curiosity about his rolling technique.

"How did I do that? No magic, just a lot of training. Years of combat and endurance build skills like that. It’s about timing and muscle control. You learn to roll and recover quickly, using momentum and strength."

He nods appreciatively.

"Good blood helps, but practice makes the difference. Keep training, and you might find yourself pulling off similar moves."

Onager motions towards the remaining camp members.

"Let’s check on everyone. We need to figure out how best to move forward."


#### 2 Iron Tail and a New Friend
A few days have passed since Torgon's Uprising. Everyone's had to pull double shift to make up for the lack of manpower.

Yarl's been running around, managing the camp as per usual, while conducting interviews.
He's visibly tired.

He approaches Iron-Tail with a form on a clipboard and a quill of ink.

Iron Tail. Glad I caught you.

You, Derby and Onager have been pulling your weight around here, and then some. It's been a blessing.

As per when I created this band, I wanted everyone to chip in. This means chipping in recruitment thoughts as well.

His eyes are sunken as he hands the clipboard to you. He's tired.

The form is a list of potential recruits.
You read through it.

1. Ravenna "Shade" Valek
2. Brom "Hammer" Stonefist
3. Mira "Silver Tongue" Voss
4. Kael "Whisper" Thorn
5. Lyra "Spark" Emberwind Role: Demolition Expert and Pyromancer


"Torgon planned to take over, yes, but he was also a natural born businessmen. He got us discounts on wares from merchants who wouldn't tell me the time of day. Maybe we need someone like him again.

Or maybe a sniper arbalist type. Derby's told me a story of how one pinned him down for a few days. That's a useful addition.

You tinker all day. Maybe we can hire someone with mechanical know how?

Up to you."

You sense that Yarl is tired, and will probably approve of who you decided to hire on.

Oh, there's more recruits on the following pages. You've got about 20 recruits in total, about. 4 pages.

"If you need someone to help smooth things over with clients, I could always lend a hand. My swampy charms lend a bit of weight to negotiations."

Iron flips through the entire booklet of recruits, just to be through. Wouldn't want to miss someone just because they were all the way in the back!

A loose page flies out of the clipboard.

It's another list of people to hire. But this list has people with no combat capabilities.

21. Gilda "Brightforge" Ironhand - Role: Arcane Blacksmith and Metalworker
22. Tobin "Gearsmith" Carver - Role: Mechanical Systems Engineer
23. Liora "Starling" Windwalker - Role: Advanced Drone Specialist
24. Finnian "Woodsman" Greaves - Role: Eco-Builder and Renewable Resource Engineer
25. Rowan "Spark" Alder - Role: Arcane Energy Specialist and Power Engineer

It's sparse on detail.

If you want my judgement... Miss Jenna, Oren, and Kael seem like decent candidates. If you're asking me to pick only one, then Jenna fills two roles that we could sorely use. Of the miscellaneous recruits, I wouldn't mind Gilda to hone our weapons.

Jenna the Firedancer, with 2 votes.
Oren the Shadowblade.
Kael the Sniper/Tracker.

and Gilda, the Arcane Metalworker.

"I see, I see."

He sighs. Not out of anything bad, He's simply tired. He's got uneven stubble and red eyes.

"I'll see if I can get a hold of them."

"Have you been getting enough sleep lately Yarl? If you need us to shoulder the burden, we're more than happy to help out."

He looks at you.
Well, moreso through you.

"...What did you have in mind?"

"Well, for starters, I could probably handle gathering and interviewing the potential candidates. Or at the very least help you split them up. Obviously, you should probably talk to them as you're the leader of this merry band of mercs. You have the final say of who gets in. But more than anything, I want you to know that we're a team, and you can rely on us."

He's listening to you intently, but you can tell that the moment he so much as grazes a soft fabric, he'll pass out on the dirt.

"... I appreciate that. I do.

*yawn* but the interviews have been conducted. This was my approval list.

Since the little Torgon takeover incident, I've been traveling every inch of this city to find good replacements. Ones that won't organize a hostile takeover.

They all seemed receptive to tag along. Anything to get out of this city, I suppose. So much talent.

You liked Jenna on paper, right? She sounds like a good combat asset?

I found her in the carnival last night. She was throwing fire daggers clear across the tent. Hit every mark AND made delicious barbeque.

Some people just aren't blessed to realize their true potential by themselves. They need a little push from someone who cares. Maybe we all do."

He folds the paper on the clipboard and begins to walk away.

"I appreciate what you said. Okay, I'll depend on you just a little bit. Let me get some sleep and think about that."


Have a good night Yarl. Get some sleep.

He walks backwards to face you and flashes a weak smile.

...
The next day Yarl has you taking the big caravan wagon with Onager to collect wares for the camp. Foods, Materials, Kerosene, etc. He asks that you do what you can to renegotiate their deals.

It was like a good guard/ bad guard routine. The whole wagon tips towards Onager's side as it pulls to the merchant's business.

Onager did say he wasn't feeling well, and was quite irritable. He had a murderer's expression on the whole day. He was 6'8" mess of easily irritable half-orc.

It was either deal with him, or deal with you. *They chose to deal with you.*

What you call ' your swampy charm' is a hit with the merchants. You even manage to secure a few discounts here and there.

With since you're both rather strong, you didn't need additional hands, which gave you both more storage space in the wagon.

Yarl looks better rested when you two return from a day of bargaining and moving wares.

Oh, Iron-Tail, look who joined us while you were gone.

You see a young woman with pale skin, bright red hair, and foreign clothes from a far land. She's sheepishly looking around.

Jenna, this is Iron-Tail. She's the one who recommended you.

She's from the swamps. She's got some engineering experience from what I gather, and enjoys tinkering around with tech.

H-Hi.

Iron Tail
"Well, hey there! Welcome to the band. As Yarl said, I'm, Iron-Tail. I'm the one who vouched for you, although to be fair, Yarl also vouched for you to come on. A pleasure to meet face to face with you."

Iron-Tail holds her arms out, expecting a hug.

Jenna
"...Are you sure?"

She doesn't wait. She walks into you and embraces you tightly as though she hasn't hugged anyone in a long while.

You hear sizzling.

When she pulls away, there's a light smoke and smell of scorch around you. Your clothes have been singed and imprinted by her hands and clothes.

Ooof. Yeah. She's.. *Emberborn*, was it? Lavakin? It's all the same meaning really, from different languages. I remember it as Fire Genasi. A being of fire.

She runs hot. Not enough to start fires when she's asleep, but if you give her a glass of water it'll start to boil in an hour.

I keep a bolt of fabric from back home. It's fireproof. I'm a *great* seamstress.

Ah. I should have guessed from the emphasis on fire. Well, no harm no foul right? Besides, it looks like you really could have used a hug anyway.


*'A Warm Personality'* her billboards would say.

Jenna looks you up and down. She smiles at you.

We'll be good friends. I know it.

I get that vibe from you too. Now, how about we celebrate our new arrival with a little party? Let's use some of the scrimpings from our deals to have a night on the town!



Yeah. Let's do it. My time at the carnival's really limited my time outside the carnival.

A night out huh... Let's see where this goes. I'll get Kaelrith.

The news of an outing tonight is spread across the camp. It just so happens that the city they're currently in, has all the makings of a good night out.

There's so many taverns huddled on the same street that one could 'crawl' from one to another. 
The new addition, Jenna, had just given up her contact that the carnival, but can talk to some people to let them through without charge.
And it seems a popular music bard is playing at a local tavern: It will be attended by the most raunchiest of nobles and peasants alike.
Tonight is the perfect night, and in close proximity to visit it all in one go.


Onager is just blowing off steam, working on bonding with the team and trying to prove he's not just a meat-bag bruiser.


Yeah. Let's do it. My time at the carnival's really limited my time outside the carnival.

A night out huh... Let's see where this goes. I'll get Kaelrith.

The camp scrambles to get ready before the sunset.
As the sun turns to a dull orange/blue, the group is ready for a fun night out:

--------------
**The Caerne Shenanigans Group Appearance:**

**Yarl**
An athletic human man with long, wavy hair and light olive skin tone. He's wearing a simple white tunic, blown belt, black pants and brown boots.

**Kaelrith**
An Owlin woman with white-black tipped feathers. She is wearing a simple black dress that reaches all the way down to the floor. She has a small red purse.

**Jenna**
An Emberkin (Fire Genasi) woman with bright orange hair and white-ashen skin. She's wearing a big jacket, black baggy pants with very intricate red/black shoes.


**Derby**
The clean shaven, human medic in his 40's. He's dressed formally and blends in with the locals.

**Onager**
The 6'8" muscular half-orc who dresses as he damn well pleases. He has his city watch uniform on. It's not formal enough for others to realize what it is, unless they're city watch themselves.

**Iron-Tail**
The muscular black-furred Ratkin that dresses however she wants to.

-------------------

Yarl
I've been so focused on work, I don't remember the last time I went out. When's the last time I just sat back and relaxed? I'm so tense.

Kaelrith
There was that one time you met that half'lin girl.

Yarl
Oh yeah. Man... I hope she's okay. Nice girl.

Kaelrith
Last I heard she caught High-Pox. No one'd hire her because of all the scabs. Or was it *you* that gave it to her...?

Yarl Shut up, shut UP, Kayla

Yarl begins to literally ruffle her feathers. Kaelrith responds by using her powerful wings to blow wind and dust at Yarl.

Yarl
AHH

He storms off to his tent to fix his hair.

Jenna is closeby, playfully dangling her legs while she sits on top of a barrel. She's sitting on her big jacket.

Kaelrith sees her. The Ownlin slowly inches her way to the Emberkin.

Kaelrith ...

Jenna ...

Kaelrith ...

He-

Umm.. Ah, *ahem.* I'm... Jenna. I'm new. Iron-Tail hired me on.

Kaelrith She didn't hire you on. Yarl did. He's the leader of the The Caerne. He's the one who hired you, Not Iron-Tail.

Jenna ...

A pause.

An *awkward* pause.

Kaelrith ... I'm...

Kaelrith Kaelrith. That's *name*. No- my name is... I'm-

She storms off. When she's at the edge of camp, she beats her white Owlin wings and takes off into the dim purple sky. 

Jenna wears a confused face.

Jenna ... was it something I said?

-----

The group is ready for their outing.

Yarl
I heard that there's a place here that specializes in different ales. Hoppy, Amber, Dark. I wanna try that.

Kaelrith: I heard there's a book place that's closing soon. I want to find something interesting to read.

Jenna : I want to go sight seeing. Work always had me so tired, I never have energy to go out.

Iron Tail : I want to have a good time, get blackout drunk, Bond with Jenna and Yarl.

Seems the group has something in mind that they want to explore.
##### **The Bookstore**
First stop is Kaelrith's stop. The original plan was the Ale Flight place, but she kept pestering Yarl that the may close soon.

And she was right. Had they come just 15 minutes later, the place would have been closed.

Kaelrith quickly explored the tiny bookstore, brushing dust off of the books that she found interesting. Her eyes would quickly dart across titles, her hands would skim through the pages.

After 10 minutes of browsing and five intense minutes of thought, she decided to pick up a book on the local area's ecosystem. Content with her purchase, she was beaming happily.

##### The Alehouse
The two-story tavern was alive and bustling with countless patrons with so many different kinds of people going in and out. Yarl went right up to the bar and ordered drinks for everybody.

To his dismay, They didn't really serve '15 different ales' as advertised. Their 'light ale' was simple ale watered down. Their 'Hoppy Variety' was just the bartender serving it with a few slams on the counter.*Called it the rabbit special.*

It's all you can drink! What more do you want, eh!? Dodn't taste like honey, but dodn't taste like piss either! If you don't like it, leave! Get Drunk and Get Out!

Regardless, the group enjoys their drinks.

Iron Tail rolled 12 

Iron-Tail is really goading Yarl into his drinks. Turns out the man is a big fan of 'the art in everything'

Yarl
It's not enough to simply get shit-faced. 

One must be shitfaced... *with decorum*.

He downs an entire flagon of ale in one go, pinky extended.

5 flagons in, Yarl isn't acting as some moral charismatic leader anymore. He's acting like some schoolboy who's testing his limits. He begins to push Onager, Dr. Derby, and Iron Tail into matching his drinking pace. 

Iron-Tail finds this entertaining and mentions it to Yarl himself.

I used to attend an institution of  *hic* high regard. I was to lead a life of extravagance and class amongst nobles and books... I found it to be tedious. Boorish, really.'

Yarl playfully bumps Iron-Tail's shoulder with his.

All that stringy muscle you've got on you. Do you- *hic* Do you know how best to implement it? what it's all good for?

He slams a full flagon of ale in front of you. It spills a few drops into your clothes

Bringing the heavy weight of this sweet, sweet , *sweeeet* ale to your lips!

He bows, then leaves you to mingle with this little party he's made for himself.

His charisma is contagious.
Yarl begins to bring others into the group. Skinny farmers who reek of manure, beautiful young noblewomen who look out of place. He's playing games with everybody, dealing cards amongst the farmers and waging small bets of copper.
He's getting everyone to open up, talk, chat it up.

He tells them exploits of The Caerne. How a dastardly betrayer, *the War Veteran Torgon*, was a hair's breadth away from taking over the band.

The noblewomen are impressed. One of them sits next to Yarl and begins to trace her finger on his chest. He pay her no mind as he continues his stories.

But the man knows his limits. 
No. No he doesn't.

Looking up from her book and half finished tankard of ale, Kaelrith sees Yarl's rowdiness increasing with each sip of Ale.

She tapers off his drinking in a very subtle way, her hand occasionally covering Yarl's flagon whenever he reaches for a sip.

At Kaelrith's request, he calms down a bit. Kaelrith pats him on the head, then resumes her place at the corner table.

Iron Tail also gets to talk to Jenna for a bit.

Seems Jenna's family comes from a portal that opened centuries ago. Only a few of her people travelled through it.

Jenna
My people are so sparse in these lands. 

She takes a long gulp of her ale and puts it upside down on the table. This must be her 3rd flagon so far.

The last time I met a fellow Emberkin was my Uncle's family, when I was 9 years old. That was 12 years ago.

She demonstrates a bit of her fire abilities to Iron-Tail.
Jenna shows you that her jacket and gloves (that she proudly made herself *ahem*) are triple layered for a reason. She scoots over so that her skin is directly touching the wooden bench. 

She just sits there a few moments. Then scoots back so that she's sitting back on her jacket.

There's a big scorch mark of her butt on the bench.

She looks to Iron Tail for an expression of surprise.
Then, The realization of what she did sinks in.
There's *a permanent scorch mark of her ass on this bench*.

She moves her jacket on top of it and sits there to hide the mark.

The party is buzzed and having a good time.
Yarl decides to transfer to the next festivity, continue the night out.

Jenna is the last to leave. With a deep breathe, she drinks the last of her 4th flagon of ale, grabs her jacket and promptly leaves before anyone sees the ass-scorchmark.

##### Sight seeing

The group is now headed to the Carnival: Jenna's old work place.

Along there way, the party notices how lively the city's gotten at night. There's teenagers and adult all roaming about, travelling from tavern to tavern. There are street musicians and food stands. portable market stalls out of trade wagons. 

There's a giant fountain in the center that catches Jenna's eye. It's a 10 statue of a tiefling man, riding a horse, with water shooting out of the horse's mouth and into the fountain.

The Plaque reads "Kavik, the savior of the land."

There's a mustached man with a strange wooden box nearby.

Oh, I know what that is! I know him from *hic* from another town!

Jenna grabs Iron-Tail's hand and brings her along to talk to the man. The both of them return and usher the group to the front of the fountain.

What are yo-

Shush! Just trust us!

The man gets behind the wooden box and puts a blanket over himself. 

"Alright now, stay proper."
The group is puzzled. No one moves. Only Jenna and Iron Tail is keeping a smile.


A **flash of light**.
 
Everyone is dazed from the bright light. It was as if the sun reappeared for just a moment.

Then several intermittent flashes of light.


"Just a moment, I've to change the film...
Alright now, an improper expression. Posture!"

Jenna
Make a silly face! Do a silly move! Hurry!

Everyone strikes a pose.

Several more flashes.

Everything looks darker than before. 

Jenna and Iron tail continue to talk with the man. They exchange something with the man and return to the group.

Jenna
Look!

Jenna is holding several pieces of parchment. She takes a glove off and snaps her fingers, providing a small light.

It's... several drawings of the group in front of the fountain.

Yarl
Ah. A magical sketch of some kind? I'm sure Kayla could have done this herself -ow-, Kayla don't poke me there, I'm still cut up from Torgon...

Kaelrith
No, it doesn't *feel* magical. How peculiar.

Jenna
He said its a thing of powder, reverse light... I don't know, I didn't go to school.

**Yarl:**  
“A keepsake for the group! Good thinking. It’s only been half a day, but you’re really showing your smarts, Jenna. I knew you were a fine addition to the team.”

Jenna blushes, and the spaces between her long hairs flicker with a tiny flame.

Each group member takes a photo for themselves.

**Everyone receives a Keepsake Photo!**

The group finds Onager’s expression particularly hilarious. He’s making a kissy face, perfectly aligned with the hero’s statue behind him.

The group continues to explore, encountering women in various fashions and other mercenaries like themselves. They occasionally duck into taverns to keep their buzz going.

**Derby** explains to a group of wizards that inebriation isn’t caused by tiny snakes but by ale being a mild sedative that affects the brain through the liver and stomach, much like food or water.

**Wizard:**  
“Wha—NO. We learned this in the academy. The snakes bite you in the stomach over and over again, and the venom poisons your thoughts. Any bigger and the snake venom kills you. You have to eat bread; the snakes eat the bread. They become happy and don’t bite anymore. Then you just piss them out.”

...

Before long, the band is in front of a medieval carnival, at the edge of town.

#### The Carnival

A large steam generator is occasionally flushing steam out one of its higher ports. It's got a center tower, like the thick mast of a ship.

Connected to it is lanterns that bathe the carnival in a golden, steady light. Stalls line the streets like the merchants all throughout the city. Laughter, music, the smell of roasted meats.

Children are chase tiny, mechanical, steam powered soldiers and horses; and *high-pox free* at that.



##### Admission

There's a long line to get in.

"Don't worry about the line. follow me."

Jenna takes the lead. She masterfully snakes through the crowd.

Jenna? Back so soon? What happened with that travel band you were talking about?

Oh, this is them! This is the Caerne!

Oh. Mkay.
There's a little awkward pause. They both seem to be unsure of what to say.

Right, well. Darren said that I'm free to come by any time, due to all my hard work here and all.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course.

He gives the wave off. Jenna leads the party through the entrance.

##### **Past Admission**

The famous musician bards that Yarl heard about are here. they're high up on a stage, playing heavy bardic music. Everyone's busting moves in an open grassy field. The music is magically enhanced; You feel the kick of the bass drum so strongly that it's as if the drummer is beating the pedal into your chest.

A few carnival goers sit at the edges of the crowd with a blank expression. In front of them are half-naked harlequins. The harlequin's fingertips are glowing different colors, entrancing those who sit down as their fingers move in impossible motions.

Oh gods, they're here. I thought they were on the other side of town.

It's **Tiestoux**.

Kaelrith slaps Yarl across the back and moves past Jenna.

She turns, catches everyone's eyes, bows, then disappears into the crowd.

Yeah, we're not gonna worry about her. She'll be fine.

The party continues on.

Everyone is munching on giant turkey legs, playing the games, getting into small pretend arguments with the children.


As Onager and Derby prepared for his next move, they feel the **cosmos** aligning, hinting that fortune—or misfortune—was about to reveal itself: It's going to be fine.


The children are at first intimidated by Onager, gigantic size. The Half-Orc parts the crowd like a hot knife through butter.

It's only when a fellow half-orc woman gives the go ahead for her two children to approach Onager. The children are still at the age where they're the same size as any other race, discernible only by the green skin tone.

After the two come up to Onager, so do the other children.

Seems they see him as a kind of playground personified. He's swinging them around like a Roundabout and having them sit on his shoulders.

Derby on the other hand, is making small talk with the jesters and harlequins that walk past.

They're all very curious about this well dressed man in the spectacles.

At some point, the group turns around and Dr. Derby is breathing fire with a torch in hand. The jesters clap and whisper to each other in approval.










#### Cog 3: Iron Tail and the Engine

Yarl bumps into Iron-Tail and Jenna playfully.

Ladies. We're running into a problem.

I think...

...I think *i'm sobering up.*

Jenna gasps playfully

Oh, *whatever shall we dOooOo*

Our Orcish friend and Medic Extraordinaire are indisposed.

Soon, we will all be sober. And the journey of the night will come to a dull end.

Jenna turns her head, puts a hand to her temple, like in those stage plays.

Oh, mercy! We must fix this problem posthaste! Irontail, with me, darling. I know of a man who keeps a bar, with the proper vapours and spirits for our conundrum!

She grabs Irontail and goes.

As the ladies are fetching more ale for the party, Iron Tail gets a good look at the giant machine that's powering the festival lights. The steam generator.

This close, the machine's rather loud as it chugs on. There's a large puddle of water all around it, radiating all around the machine about 5 feet out.

A closer look. It's the filter. You can see it right from where you're standing, but it's not directly noticeable unless you're used to it. It's dirty and moldy. The water generators back home in the swamps were always kept clean.

The engineer's right there. A human man with a yellow construction helmet on and a big belly.

You explain to him that 'using dirty water filter needs replacement. The gunk inside the generator makes it work harder and wear out faster. The pipes can get clogged, and the machine might even crack or burst. The machine needs clean water to keep running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.'

...

He grabs a wrench from a toolbox on a crate nearby.

And immediately swings at you, right for the side your head. You pull your head out just in time as the wrench clangs against the steam generator pipes.

...You beastfolk are something else.

Truly truly, something else.

...I will *not* be talked down to by a ***overgrown. PEST***.

Do you hear me!?

Just because your kind can *slur* the Common language, don't mean diddly squat to me.

Disgusting swamp rat.  I can smell the sewer off you and yours.

He turns to Jenna.

***...we got a problem, torchlight?***

She takes a few steps back, unsure of what to do.

Yeah.

That's what I thought.

He turns to his console and disregards you both.

(under his breathe)
{Ain't *no one* gonna tell me how to keep the carnival lights on. That generator's been fine for year's; it'll be fine for another 10.

I've stomped rats bigger than you dead. Think I'll treat you any different because you squeak my language? try again.}



What does Iron Tail do?

Iron Tail Thoughts
"It would be so easy to just walk away from all of this and have this be merely an unpleasant bookend to an otherwise fantastic evening out. It's not like she worked for the carnival, and if the carnival suffered because of an incompetent, racist technician, there would be no skin off her back. But she was just prideful enough, and inebriated enough to want to intervene anyway. But first, she was going to humble this bigot. Iron-Tail pretends to walk away from the technician, but just as they exit from view, she swivels around and casts command, uttering a single word."

"Piss."

The man is going about his business, looking busy. He's flicking switches back and forth, turning knobs that don't need to be turned.

A warm sensation in his groin, trailing down.

He looks down, horrified. He's gone and pissed himself.

A halfling passes the girls and walks up to the rude man. Iron Tail reads the back of his construction vest. '**Superintendent**'.

"Henry, I need you to take a look at the maintenance logs.

You've been writing that you do rust checks every 4 hours on the dot, but just the other day I saw a bit of rust *here and there*.

I need you so show me how you conduct your ch-"

He stops when he sees the large urine stain on his pants. It's directly eye level to the halfling.

"... *Okayyyy*. I see there's a few things we need to talk about."

I'm gonna go find someone to relieve you. Then we're gonna talk about inappropriate appearance around minors.

He starts walking away, shaking his head.

"{hehehe... just can't find good help...}"

Jessa pulls Iron-Tail away from all this and towards their intended stop.

Oh my gods, *I cannot believe that just happened*. I pass that guy all the time at work, there was just something so *creepy* about him, couldn't say why. Then he goes and pisses himself right after trying to fight you? Think he got too excited? Omigods, like, *gross*!

Jenna links arms with Iron-Tail and laugh about the whole exchange.

The jacket was a good idea. This time around, it doesn't singe your arm, but rather feels nice and toasty.

The girls continue on their way.

Occasionally, they are stopped by a few men who attempt to flirt with them, asking them to play carnival games with them. 

Task at hand, they politely refuse.

They procure drinks and continue back to the group.

## 3rd Punch: The Merc who Stayed

As you're playing with the children and enjoying your time as 'Mr. Playground', you see it. The corner of your eye. You can't believe what you're seeing.

You set the half-orc girl down and stare by a carnival stall.

You hope you're wrong.

No. You're right. You're always right about these things.

At the dart throw stall, it's ***one of the two mercenaries from before.*** 

A human with a big, bushy beard.

Look's like he's on a date. The date looks like she's having fun, holding onto a pretty big teddy bear.

It's only a matter of time before Yarl sees him. You're not sure how he'll act. Not sure with these many kids and witnesses around.

You remember his words.
''I see any of you two again - passing in the street-, off chance in a tavern, ***I break you***. then and there."

All this time with him, you know him to be true to every promise; and every threat.

Distract the group away? Tell Yarl what you saw? Show them the same respect you showed the scarred veteran Torgon?

"Excuse me children but I see an old friend I need to have a word with.  I'll be back in a moment."

...he says gently placing the airborne and otherwise elevated children on the ground before walking directly toward the man and his date.

With a polite smile he says to the mercenaries date...  "Excuse me miss but might I borrow your companion for a moment?"

Onager guides him a few feet away, whether he likes it or not, still smiling back at his date.

"The Yarl is a spears throw away and will certainly at the very least cripple you if he sees you.  My suggestion to you is you tell your young companion I've notified you of urgent business and you regret that you must depart.  Stay at your own peril."

"I must return to the children, sorry to be the bearer of ill tidings.  Do take care."

With that he lets the man's arm go and casually returns to the waiting children.

Onager returns to the heart of the festivities.

He casts a glance behind him. The woman is holding onto her teddy bear, looking around for her bearded companion. Seems he's left earlier than planned.

Yarl
"Onager, where did you go? You were gone long enough for the -Ow! For the little ones to find someone else to bully. They've chosen me as their latest target."

The young half-orc girl is laughing as she and her brother are running around Yarl.

Suddenly she yanks on Yarl's arm. She's only about 4 feet tall, yet her one sudden pull forces Yarl forward like a ragdoll. He's off balance.


"My, aren't you str**oh gODS**.

... Onager, I see the strength kicks in your people *very* quickly."

The 2 women of the group return with as many flagons as they can carry.

Jenna
"We've returned! The day is saved!"

The group cheers. Everyone takes a flagon and maintains the positive energies all around.

The rest of the night is a blur of ale, heavy bardic bass and cheerful orchestra...










## **The Morning After:**
The Caerne Camp
Sunrise

The camp is, in a sense, in ruins. 



Random couples and new friends can be found all throughout the camp. Tents are toppled over with strangers sleeping *on top*.

Yarl is tightly wrapped up on the branch of a tree nearby.

Dr. Derby is in Yarl's battle leathers, helmet and all, sleeping cozy on Yarl's tent, with a beautiful half-elf woman no one's ever met. She's wearing Onager's 'Udo Uniform; it fits like a twin size bed cover.

Jenna is sleeping cozy in her pajamas, on top of a still active campfire. 

Onager is fast asleep with countless buckets of water stacked on top of him. There's 4 halflings in their boxers playing cards. for the pot: Each other's clothes stacked on a pile.

Iron-Tail reeks of fish. The whole night she was cuddling with a pumpkin. Someone painted Yarl's face on it. On the other side, Dr. Derby's face.

Kaelrith is awake, making several egg spinach omelettes.
She's got on makeup that makes her look like a clown.

A silhouette is cast over Kaelrith. She turns to see:
A young catfolk beastman and a gorgeous elven woman in white clothing.


The Tabaxi (aka Leonin)
"See? we're gone for a big correspondence and look what happens."

...

Kaelrith
Oh. Anna. You're back. I'm making breakfast for everyone. We got a bit wild last night, celebrating the addition of the latest member in our band. Jenna, she's a Firefolk. A bit shy, you'll like her. Doesn't carry that stink, if you know what I mean.

So how was it? It go well?


The Elf speaks in a magically quiet tone. It's as if the bird calls of the morning are stifled under fabric when she speaks.

"... Gather the Band. We're to meet with a king."

In the distance, Yarl's voice rings out:
{What the- Someone get me out of this bullshit! How did I get here? Help!}

End of Act 1
