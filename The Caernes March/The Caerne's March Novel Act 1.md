## **Act 1: The Princess and the Goblins**

Spring has ended for The Caerne. This will be their First Summer. In just a few weeks, the group has undergone much change.

**Old Members:**

- **Anna:** The serious Elf woman and Herald of The Caerne. She has organized the group's latest mission: Princess Rescue.
- **Yarl:** The Leader and face of The Caerne. A relaxed spirit, true to his word.
- **Kaelrith:** An Owlin Magic User. An introvert with a deep knowledge of magic.
- **Hawk:** The Leonin Scout of the group, tasked with scouting the area before deployments.

**New Members:**

- **Dr. Derby:** The medic of the group.
- **Onager:** A Half-Orc Former City Watch Investigator and the muscle of The Caerne.
- **Iron-Tail:** A Nezumi Ratfolk, part-time engineer of the band with a knack for machines.
- **Jenna:** An Emberkin with a talent for throwing blades. She's also a skilled cook and tailor.
- **Gilda:** A Halfling Engineer.


They're talking about their goals.








The group has successfully dealt with a Goblin infestation. In a brightly lit, mossy stone cave, they stand amidst countless fallen Goblins. Their boss, a hairless bugbear and a Goblin mutation, is on one knee, battered and bloodied from Onager's blows, cuts from Derby's rapier, and Iron-Tail’s attacks.

How do you want to do this?
**Roll for final kill**



The Bugbear, weakened and struggling, looks up at the group. How do you want to execute the final blow?

Bugbear **Death**

**Tabaxi:**

“See? I told you this place would be worth the trouble.”

**Yarl:**

“That was the last of them?”

He removes his helmet with a heavy breath and begins stabbing the dead bodies with his spear to ensure they are truly dead.

**Tabaxi:**

“Let’s see... 20, 23, 27... That should be it. We’ll have to consult Kaelrith.”

He pulls out a mirror from his pack, moving to a spot where sunlight directly hits. Spinning the mirror in his hand, he reflects the sunlight.

Overhead, a birdlike figure—Kaelrith—caws twice: one long call and one short.

“… Two calls. Long and short. That means one’s on the move and one’s still alive. I’ll handle the runner.”

He climbs the ivy like a panther, dislodging clumps of rock behind him.

**Roll to dodge**

“Oops! My bad!”

A loud shriek follows.

**Jenna:**

“Got the one.”

She takes out her own mirror and mirrors Kaelrith’s signal. She emits a single long call.

**Jenna:**

“That’s it. We’re good here. Hawk will handle the last one.”

The princess clings to Yarl.

“Oh, my savior! My flame! I was so scared.”

**Yarl:**
“It’s alright, miss. We’ll get you home safe and sound. Guys, I’m going to take the princess back to the wagon. I’ll stay there with Anna and Kayla to keep her safe. You’re all on treasure and ear duty. Stay clear of the rocks overhead; this place is a breath away from collapsing.”

"Don't take too long. It's 2 days time to get the princess back. We have to assume people know about this job, and that they might be waiting for us. Worst case, just grab the more valuable stuff and let's go."


They both leave.

Jenna juggles knives as she surveys the open cavern.

"I don't... I don't want to cut the ears off. It's gross. Someone else please?"

“Man, it’s been months since we joined the Caerne, and every day’s felt like a bard’s tale. It feels like I’ve been with all of you longer than I was a Fire Dancer.”



“What about you guys? How’s it been for you?”

---

“Hey! Make space!”

Hawk, the felinefolk scout of the Caerne, shouts from above as he pushes a goblin down a 20-foot cliffside.

“Every silver counts. Oh, and I saw the treasure. It’s in the next cavern over. Follow me and watch your step.”

The group follows Hawk through a path increasingly choked with vines and greenery.

They enter a room that seems to offer just one place to stand.

“No, look down. That’s it right there!”

Below them lies a haphazard collection of metals and weapons—both rusted and clean. At the center, a gigantic statue stands, surrounded by the goblins’ thrown treasures, seemingly offered as tribute to their statue god. At the top of the statue is what looks like a topaz.

“Is that a topaz on that statue? It’s mine!”

A slip. Hawk steps on a loose rock.

Rocks begin to fall, and the lichen-covered ground becomes slippery. The group scrambles to avoid the falling boulders.

Iron-Tail falls into the broken statue. The statue starts to emit a blue light, rumbling and vibrating as it encloses Iron-Tail in darkness.

Strange lights appear, and squares open around her. She finds herself looking down at the party from within the statue, as if she has become part of it.

What do you do?




Shit! The treasure! Grab what you can! We need the coin!

Perception Check x10 Seconds

10+ = Treasure Piece.
20 = Magical Item.

For Each additional roll: Roll an Attribute/Skill of choice. If 14+ = Treasure Piece.

Onager is taking the Brunt.

The Cave's collapse.

Yarl:

"What the hell happened? Where's Iron Tail?


You're you're inside the statue? How is that possible?"

It's cool inside. Air conditioned.

Kaelrith
This is... This is unheard of. It's as big as a giant!

Yarl
"Should Onager break you out? Can you get out of it yourself?"

"Hmmm... I can see the scholars freak out about this. It's nothing I've seen before."

"Dr. Derby. Your thoughts?"

Can't leave it here...

Fine. We take it with us. But no one can see it. We don't know what it can do, or if it's a threat to us.

It stays in the treeline. We camp around it."

---------------

Sunset

Let's take a look at the spoils.

Hmm. Good haul.

You found it, you claim it. Otherwise we sell it and divy the revenue, minus upkeep.

Kayla, do the math. How much do we all get?

Good.

Review.

We return the princess, let the people celebrate her return.

Usually, we move on to the next settlement. But now...
He's looking at the statue.

"...Ideas?"

Anna = It's massive and exudes strength. We keep it. Learn to use it.
Hawk = We sell it to the Aethermancers. It's gotta sell for a high price.
Kaelrith = It's too big. It'll slow us down. Best we sell it.
Jenna = Maybe we can find someone to teach us how to use it.

Princess?
"It's like a knight in shining armor for a whole town! Do you think there's a horse statue to go along with it?"

And you three? Thoughts?

... I wanna sell it. Anna and the Princess makes a good point, it feels like a town's personal godknight. That'll bring in the jobs. 
But it's so unknown. What if it runs on dark magic? What does it even run on? We can't stay here and figure it out, we have to return the princess as soon as we can.

...I'm gonna think it over. Until 9am tomorrow.

------------------
What do you do?

1 PC/ 2 Choices/ Night 

Talk to someone
Do Something




Shoot. I lost that piece of paper with all those engineers on it. Maybe they can help. 




Okay. It's settled. 

We get the princess home first. Then we talk the moving statue.


Now, the next topic.



He takes out a map.

Where should we go? Our Herald Anna's done well with finding us this job. Now she wants to relax a bit. Somewhere new. We gotta pick a route. And it just so happens, we got two relevant choices:

-  Onager's City > Beach
- Iron-Tail's Side of the Swamp > Mountain Hot Springs





**Looting Results:**

## **Gained 2 Treasure!**  
1 Treasure = 1,000 gp.

The mission brought in 3,000 gp. After spending 1,000 gp on group expenses like buying wares, feeding animals, maintenance, and additional payments, the group has a net profit of 2,000 gp.

**Buying** 

What will you purchase with the remaining 2,000 gp?
