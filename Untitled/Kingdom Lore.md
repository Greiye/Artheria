#### Before the Red Kingdoms
There are several kingdoms out there, each one ruled by a king. 
In the past, they warred with each other for land and resources.


#### Azul Empire
A cut throat businesswoman had discovered a resource.
She monopolized the resource immediately, leveraging her contacts and resources to amass an enormous fortune. It enabled a worthy army; The Azulan Army.

Her business acumen and new position of an army enabled the rapid development of 2 towns to combine into one city. What would have taken several decades, took her only half a year. 

She then sieged and conquered one kingdom after another. In one instance, she took full control of a walled castle in just 48 hours.


#### **The Candlewater Conflict**
Seeing the advancing threat of new and unknown technology, the kings put aside their differences and banded together for survival.

A war kept on for a few years.

Succeeding her own kingdom to death, the speed of growth was too much. A ceasefire was called. She abandoned some kingdoms to fend for themselves while she stayed and improved on the first two towns, now known as 'Topaz'. the two towns are known as the crown and the culet (gem terminology)

Today
The ceasefire is still active to this day. Many believe it only a matter of time before the Azulan Army shows once more.

#### Derby's Involvement
He was a field medic then. His unit was abandoned while in Red Kingdom territory. He knows firsthand the monstrous force of his Azulan comrades.

There Azulan Army was not evil: They healed who they could. Derby did heal Etan Pendragon, after all, in the chaos of triage.

Considering that his unit was just left and forgotten in enemy territory, he considered it best if he hid all his soldier gear.

Except for his old **Cavalry Rapier**. It's made of quality steel. Light. Dense. The only tell that it's an Azulan weapon is on the hilt: A design of a gemstone and a lanyard hole where a deep blue tassle used to hang. Derby has since removed it. 


Azulan Empress Secrecy
The Empress's name became a secret during her rise to power. There's rumors that she ordered every noble family that knew her name to hang. There's also rumors that she went crazy with power that she changes her name daily.

Everyone simply calls her the Empress

Azulan Empress Secrecy: War Machines
She has every war machine accompanied or operated by spellcasters that use spells to obscure the machines from sight.

No one knows what the machines look like; only that they are machines.

Azulan soldiers of Derby's rank and purpose only knew that the machines were considered the 'cavalry', and nothing more.

Anywhere the Cavalry is heard to appear, there is rainstorms and fog; darkness in the day, and fellow Azulan Soldiers gone blind, deaf, or both. Derby's triage leader felt it best that they avoid the cavalry in any scenario.
