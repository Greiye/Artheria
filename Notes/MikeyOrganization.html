                <p> March 23: Figure is section for image and captions.
                    <br> My own database?
                    <br>Emmet VSCode for HTML? Soon as I start the beginning of the code, with emmet set up, All i have to do is hit tab and it autofills.
                    <br>Section and href to section with id (href id ="example3")
                    <br>Is that better? Maybe. I really like details tag tho, lol
                    <br>Filepaths
                    <br><img src="picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
                    <br><img src="images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
                    <br><img src="/images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
                    <br><img src="../picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder
                    <br><br>
                    <br> How does HTMl on a local network work?
                    <br> I can test mobile app and html local internet via SQLite.
                    <br> SQLite good for prototyping.
                    <br>for game applications, I can use SQLite, update real time locations of players for multiplayer.
                    <br>drag and for Loot? for Pat?
                    <br>Web workers? do things in the background? it can keep a timer in the background. Maybe DnD timing? like, for session parts and battle timing. Web workers require API. 
                    <br>HTML store idea
                    <br>It looks like a walk around store. Items are displayed in shelves. Items show in specific area per category. Players can mouse over it. Tooltip information. take to shop keep. walk out. item is in database.
                    <br> SASS is CSS efficiency improver.
