                                            <br> How does HTMl on a local network work?
                                            <br> I can test mobile app and html local internet via SQLite.
                                            <br> SQLite good for prototyping.
                                            <br>for game applications, I can use SQLite, update real time locations of
                                            players for
                                            multiplayer.
                                            <br>drag and for Loot? for Pat?
                                            <br>Web workers? do things in the background? it can keep a timer in the
                                            background. Maybe
                                            DnD timing? like, for session parts and battle timing. Web workers require
                                            API.
                                            <br>HTML store idea
                                            <br>It looks like a walk around store. Items are displayed in shelves. Items
                                            show in
                                            specific area per category. Players can mouse over it. Tooltip information.
                                            take to shop
                                            keep. walk out. item is in database.
                                            <br> SASS is CSS efficiency improver.
